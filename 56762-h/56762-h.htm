<h3>INTRODUCTION.</h3>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">In</span> a land which depends to a very large extent on agricultural
and pastoral pursuits and industries some knowledge of the
animal and vegetable life of the country should be taught in every
school, and the love of Nature in all her varied aspects should be
inculcated in every child. The best way of acquiring such knowledge
is by observation, and every child is more or less a naturalist
from the start. It has been said that man is a classificatory
animal, and it is wonderful how most children begin to collect
such objects as interest them, and how, unconsciously, they begin
to classify them.</p>

<p>But, hand-in-hand with observational work, a certain amount
of instruction is very helpful, and if the one can work in harmoniously
with the other progress in the knowledge of Nature is
greatly facilitated. Books conveying instruction in botany are
common enough, but those dealing with the rudiments of zoological
work in a form sufficiently attractive to the uninformed reader
are by no means numerous. I do not know of any work dealing
with the animals which are frequently met with in New Zealand,
and in the hope of partly supplying this want I propose to write
a few sketches of the wild life of the country, in which I shall
attempt to give some account of those which are most common.
The late Professor Hutton and Mr. James Drummond, of Christchurch,
published some years ago a valuable work entitled
“Animals of New Zealand,” which should be in every school
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>library. This, besides being rather expensive for most private
readers, is a more or less technical work, and deals only with
the higher vertebrate fauna indigenous to these Islands. Excellent
little articles appear from time to time in the <i>School Journal</i>, but
these are not readily procurable.</p>

<p>In all centres of settlement the animal life is almost as much
due to foreign immigration as the people are; but observers cannot
tell this fact without some assistance, and one of the difficulties
with which all embryo naturalists are met is to know which plants
and animals are native and which are introduced. Let me illustrate
this.</p>

<p>Living as I do in a suburb of Dunedin, just outside the Town
Belt, I observe in my walks that in this neighbourhood certain
species of birds are very common. They are house-sparrows, blackbirds,
thrushes, starlings, and hedge-sparrows. These are all
forms which have been introduced from Great Britain. Almost
as abundant, but more erratic in their occurrence, are wax-eyes
(or twinkies) and goldfinches&mdash;the former a somewhat recent immigrant,
apparently from Australia, and the latter introduced from
Britain. Less abundant in varying degree are grey warblers,
tomtits, fan-tailed flycatchers, chaffinches, greenfinches, an occasional
yellowhammer, and a little brown owl. The first three are
natives, the rest are introduced. The native bell-bird (or korimako)
visits the gardens from time to time, especially when the
trees are in flower; while occasionally in the outlying districts one
hears or sees a tui or a morepork: these are all natives. In the
more open country introduced skylarks are common, as are the
native ground-larks, or pipits. On the seashore are numerous
species of birds, but these are all indigenous species. On still
nights one often hears the black swans flying overhead in their
migrations from one sheet of water to another: these were introduced
from Western Australia.</p>

<p>About the house are occasionally a few mice, and in town brown
rats are common. These are not kept in check by the dogs and
cats which are common in many houses. During the nights hedgehogs
roam about the gardens, and are far more common than
unobservant people have any notion of. All these and the other
mammals met with, such as horses and cattle, sheep, goats, pigs,
and rabbits, were originally introduced, mostly from Britain.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>
<p>When I go to work in the garden I turn up numerous earthworms,
nearly all belonging to introduced species&mdash;unless I start to
trench in new ground, when I come on native species. The wood-lice
are introduced; so are the earwigs, which are so common in
the north end of Dunedin; so are all the slugs and snails. The
bees and humble-bees are introduced, as are the large drone-flies
which visit so many of our flowers in autumn and early winter.
Nearly all the plants in our fields, orchards, and gardens, cultivated
ones and weeds alike, are of foreign origin; so are the
aphides and scale insects which infest them. The flies which infest
our houses and carry dirt and disease in all directions are
foreigners; so are the borers which destroy our houses and furniture;
and so also are bugs, fleas, and lice, which are harboured
in dirty surroundings.</p>

<p>The question might well be asked, Where do the native species
come in? The answer would have to be that wherever man goes
certain species of animals and plants follow him, and become established
if the conditions are suitable; while another section he
either takes with him for their utility or introduces afterwards
for various reasons; and the native species gradually get pushed
out.</p>

<p>Let us consider these two kinds of introductions. The only
mammals in New Zealand which were introduced by man unconsciously
are rats and mice. These accompany man wherever he
goes and settles, and do so very much against his will. All the
other forms&mdash;horses, opossums, wallabies, cattle, sheep, goats, pigs,
deer, dogs, cats, hares, rabbits, hedgehogs, and guinea-pigs&mdash;were
introduced of set purposes. All the introduced birds were also
brought to this country on purpose. So were the introduced fishes&mdash;salmon,
trout, carp, perch, tench, turbot, &amp;c. So were the frogs.
As we get lower down the scale of the animal kingdom we find
the self-introduced forms increasing in proportion and number,
and those brought in for definite reasons becoming fewer.</p>

<p>No fewer than twenty-eight species of slugs and snails have
been introduced into the country. Of these, one&mdash;a water-snail
(<i>Lymnaea stagnalis</i>)&mdash;was brought here for the purpose of feeding
imported trout; all the rest were imported among some kind of
agricultural or horticultural produce. The case of the insects is
especially interesting. About 270 species have been introduced.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
Those kinds which were first brought for some definite purpose
were silkworms, then honey-bees, and later humble-bees. An unsuccessful
attempt was also made to introduce the cochineal insect.
The silkworms, which are, of course, not wild animals in any
sense of the term, never became established, but they can still
be obtained from a few dealers. The humble-bees were brought
here for the special purpose of fertilizing red clover; and
thus obtaining seed from the plants, instead of having constantly
to import seed from abroad. In more recent years
eleven species of insects&mdash;mostly ichneumons and ladybirds&mdash;have
been introduced by the Department of Agriculture to cope with
other insects which have become pests, the larvae of the former being
parasites in the bodies of their prey, the latter feeding directly
upon aphides. All the other introduced insects&mdash;that is, over 250
species&mdash;have been brought here unwittingly.</p>

<p>Nineteen species of earthworms have found their way into the
country, most probably among the earth and the roots of introduced
plants.</p>

<p>It will thus be seen that wherever people are settled in New
Zealand the greatest number of animals to be met with are immigrants
like themselves. A popular account, therefore, of the wild
life of the country must deal with these introductions, as well as
with those native forms which are still to be met with commonly.
This, then, must be my apology for writing some sort of consecutive
account of the common animals which are now to be found
near the haunts of men, as well as of those which take some finding.
Descriptions of introduced animals are to be obtained only by
reading books of natural history dealing with other countries, or
in isolated articles, such as the useful leaflets issued from time to
time by the Department of Agriculture.</p>

<p>Nearly all children, and a majority of grown-up people as well,
are fond of natural history, and many who have lost the early
taste find it revive when they are brought in contact with it later.
I should feel rewarded if this little book should stimulate the love
of nature in any of its readers, and especially if it would cause
a more general desire for nature-study to spring up in our schools.</p>

<p>The first Europeans who landed in New Zealand and who came
to know something of the animals which were to be met with were
those who came with Captain Cook in his visit here in 1769. They
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
found that the birds and beasts were very different from those
they had known in the Homeland from which they had come. They
also noticed that there were very few animals or plants which were
desirable for food, or which were likely to furnish food to later
arrivals; and Cook was sufficiently far-seeing to recognize that
before long many of his countrymen would come to these Islands
either to visit them or to stay. These early European voyagers
found that the Maoris, whom they met for the first time, and who
were far more numerous than they are now, had no domestic
animals except dogs, which they kept for food. They also found
that a rat was very common in many parts; but they met with no
other four-footed animals, except, probably, lizards.</p>

<p>So Cook and those who followed him thought it would be a good
thing for the country, and for the Europeans who might come later
to live in it, if the best and most useful animals and plants which
occurred in Britain were brought to New Zealand. They were, then,
the pioneers in starting the introduction of European forms by
giving the Natives pigs, goats, fowls, and seeds of several plants.
Other animals and plants were brought here from time to time, and
as white people increased in number, and gradually occupied much
of the land and brought it into cultivation, these introduced forms
in certain localities soon displaced many of the native forms. All
the thickly peopled and settled parts of New Zealand are much
more like parts of Europe as far as animals and plants are concerned
than they are like the New Zealand which Cook knew. The
reason is that wherever white men go to settle they take with them
certain animals and plants, which they keep and cultivate.
Besides, as already said, a great many things come into the new
country with the immigrants&mdash;things which are not wanted, perhaps,
but which follow white men wherever they go&mdash;and these
things frequently become very common. We call the plants
“weeds” because they grow where they are not wanted. But we
have no name for the uninvited animals&mdash;mostly small&mdash;which thus
come into the country, until perhaps they become very common,
and then we just call them “pests”&mdash;nasty hurtful things to be
destroyed and got rid of.</p>

<p>Now, if we are going to study the natural history of the country&mdash;both
its native (or indigenous) and introduced animals and
plants&mdash;we must put away from our minds the idea of “weeds”
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
and “pests,” and look at and think of them as wonderful works
of creation, full of beauty and interest. All nature is full of
beauty, and if one looks for this it will be found everywhere. It
will also be found that the study of the book of nature is unending.
It does not stop, like the story of a book, but the more one learns
and the more one comes to know the more one will find fresh
chapters opening. If you are a naturalist, a true lover of Nature,
and study her for half a century, you will find at the end of that
time that you are only beginning to learn a little about the wonderful
things which occur and exist in this wonderful world in which
we live.</p>

<p>In describing the more common animals of New Zealand I am
going to follow the regular order in which a naturalist would
probably catalogue them.</p>

<p>At this point a word is necessary as to the names to be used.
Some people profess to object very strongly to the use of technical
names, and say, “Give us English names that we can understand.”
The objection is absurd, and arises from ignorance and want of
thought. How could a naturalist give English names to the
thousands of native and introduced moths, beetles, and flies already
known? To take a more special case among the beetles alone, how
could he distinguish among the twenty-five species of native and
the half-dozen or more introduced ladybirds? The thing cannot be
done. On the other hand, technical names are given on a definite
and simple plan, and are really not difficult to master. We use
them every day in speaking of garden-plants&mdash;<i>Anemone</i>,
<i>Crocus</i>, <i>Gladiolus</i>, <i>Chrysanthemum</i>, <i>Dahlia</i>,
<i>Fuchsia</i>, <i>Veronica</i>, and so on.</p>

<p>In regard to the animals we are to deal with in this book we
hardly need to use technical names, and will do so as sparingly
as possible.</p>

<p>The first and highest group in the animal kingdom are the
Mammalia. These are vertebrate (or back-boned) animals which are
fur-clad, and the females have glands which secrete milk for the
nourishment of the young. These glands open to the surface of
the body by teats, or mammae, hence the name. Mammals are all
warm-blooded animals. There are many other distinctive features
by which animals of this group are characterized, both anatomical
and physiological, but here we intend to give only the most distinctive
points.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span></p>
<p>Mammals are divided into several orders, and of these six are
now represented in the New Zealand fauna. As I do not wish to
burden these pages with technicalities, I shall give only the briefest
accounts of these orders, and mention the animals found here
which belong to them.</p>

<p>1. The animals of the order Marsupialia are popularly known
as pouched animals. Their most distinctive character is that the
mammae lie within a pouch in which the young are placed while
in an imperfect condition. Two kinds of animals belonging to
this order are wild in New Zealand&mdash;namely, wallabies and so-called
opossums.</p>

<p>2. The order Ungulata includes a large assemblage of herbivorous
animals of somewhat diverse character. They possess theoretically
five toes in each foot, but actually these are reduced to two,
or, in the case of the horse, to one toe. This reduction is accompanied
by a reduced condition of the ulna, which is fused with the
radius, and the fibula is fused with the tibia. The order includes
horses, pigs, deer, oxen, sheep, and goats, all of which are, or have
been, wild in this country.</p>

<p>3. The third order, Cetacea, forms an extraordinary group of
warm-blooded animals, which breathe air and suckle their young,
but live in the sea. It includes all the forms known as whales,
and all are indigenous to New Zealand.</p>

<p>4. The Carnivora are, as their name implies, flesh-eaters. Their
teeth have sharp cutting-edges, and the canines are well developed
to enable them to tear the flesh off their prey. The order includes
cats, dogs, stoats, ferrets, and weasels, all of which have been introduced;
and seals, which are indigenous.</p>

<p>5. The animals of the order Rodentia are only occasionally
carnivorous. All possess long incisors furnished with strong chisel-like
edges, and with these they are able to gnaw their food, from
which circumstance the name is derived. The canine teeth are
quite absent. In New Zealand are to be found rats, mice, rabbits,
and hares.</p>

<p>6. The last order represented here is the Insectivora, a group,
mostly of small animals, which is very difficult to define. The
only animal belonging to the order in New Zealand is the hedgehog.</p>

<h3>MARSUPIALIA&mdash;WALLABIES AND OPOSSUMS.</h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Numerous</span> attempts have been made to introduce various kinds of
marsupials into New Zealand, and several kinds of kangaroos,
wallabies, and opossums have been liberated in this country. At
the present time there are either three or four species found wild
in different parts.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Common Scrub Wallaby</span>; <span class="smcap">Black-tailed Wallaby</span> (<i>Macropus
ualabatus</i>).</h3>

<p>Some fifty years ago the late Mr. Studholme got some wallabies
either direct from Tasmania or from the Canterbury Acclimatization
Society, and these were set free in the neighbourhood of
his home at Waimate, in South Canterbury. They very quickly
increased, till they numbered thousands. They live in the bush,
scrub, and fern about the gullies and gorges. They come out in
the evenings to feed in the open ground. Their food consists
chiefly of grass, but they are very fond of certain trees, particularly
<i>Panax arboreum</i>, which they scratch and bark pretty badly. The
skins of those taken in winter make very fine rugs, as the fur is
thick and heavy. The flesh is said to be very palatable, and
the tails make excellent soup. They are quite large creatures&mdash;small
kangaroos, in fact&mdash;and the old bucks weigh over 60 lb.</p>

<p>About the year 1870 Sir George Grey imported some wallabies
from Australia and set them free on Kawau Island. About the
same time Mr. John Reed, of Auckland, also imported some, which
he liberated on Motutapu Island, whence they have spread to Rangitoto.
Those on Kawau increased to such an extent as nearly to
eat out the vegetation, and when the property was sold the new
owners allowed the wallabies to be killed out wholesale. They have
by now been mostly all destroyed. Even in Sir George Grey’s time
us many as two hundred would be killed in a single battue. Some
got across to the mainland&mdash;a swim of three miles&mdash;but they cannot
be very numerous. They belong to the same species as those so
common at Waimate.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Common Opossum</span> (<i>Trichosurus vulpecula</i>), <span class="smcap">and Sooty Opossum</span>
(<i>Trichosurus fuliginosa</i>).</h3>

<p>People who live in or near the bush in many parts of New Zealand
know that among the trees are to be found numerous furry
animals about the size of a big terrier dog, which are popularly
known as opossums. The name is a misnomer, like so many
popular names. The true opossums are found only in America;
they belong to a different family of marsupials, and are carnivorous.
Our animals are herbivorous, and ought to be called phalangers;
but the other name will always stick to them now.</p>

<p>These animals are not usually seen during the daytime, but
they come out at night, and, when other kinds of food are short,
may make an attack on the orchards and eat the apples and pears
as they are becoming ripe. But because they are chiefly nocturnal
in their habits young people seldom see them, and unobservant
people may live in a district containing thousands of opossums
and never know that they occur in the neighbourhood. These
animals are not natives of New Zealand. They were first brought
to this country from Australia about sixty years ago, and were
liberated near Riverton. Later importations have frequently been
made, both private individuals and acclimatization societies introducing
them. Thus the Auckland Society and Sir George Grey
brought a considerable number from Australia between 1869 and
1876, and Kawau at one time was overrun with them. The Wellington
Society liberated nineteen Tasmanian black opossums in
the ranges behind Paraparaumu in 1892; and the Otago Society
got twelve silver-grey opossums from Gippsland in 1895, and
liberated them in the Catlin’s district. They have increased greatly
in most wooded parts of the Dominion.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<a name="opossum" id="opossum"><img src="images/opossum_i_015.jpg" alt="opossum" width="497" height="700" /></a>
<p class="attr-photo">[<i>W. Beken, photo.</i></p>
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 2.&mdash;The Common Opossum.</span></p>
</div>

<p>
<br />
</p>

<p>The opossum is a marsupial&mdash;that is, its young are brought
forth in a very rudimentary condition, and are carried by the
mother in a special pouch, which is provided with teats. When
newly born they are little blind (?), naked creatures, not half as
long as one’s little finger. The mother takes the little one in her
lips and places it in the pouch with its mouth to a teat, and in this
position it is carried for about four months. For the next two
months it rides on the mother’s back, until it is able to look after
itself. It leaves its mother when about six months old, and is
then nearly half-grown. The opossum has only one young one once
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>a year. (On the other hand, the true American opossum produces
as many as a dozen at a time.) When fully grown the opossum is
about 18 in. long. It has a thick, bushy tail, about 11 in. long,
the end of which is blackish in colour. From this thick tail these
animals are sometimes known in Australia as “brush-tailed
opossums.” The legs are short and strong, and each foot is furnished
with five fingers or toes. The bodies are covered with close,
thick, woolly fur. In the first-named species the upper part of
the body is a grizzled-grey colour, with the chin blackish, a rusty
patch on the chest, and the rest of the under-surface whitish or
yellowish. In the sooty opossum the fur is of a dark brownish-black
colour. Otherwise the two species are very like one another.
The head is small and somewhat fox-like, with rather short ears.</p>

<p>These animals live in trees, taking shelter in holes during the
day, and sometimes they make a kind of rough nest at the bottom of
the hole. The trees which they frequent are often marked by the
tracks scored on the trunk by the sharp claws of the animals as
they climb. They ascend the trees in a succession of jerks or short
jumps, stretching out their feet and claws as far as possible on
each side, and rarely losing their hold. In descending a tree they
always come down head first.</p>

<p>In Australia opossums feed on the leaves of various species of
<i>Eucalyptus</i> (or gum) trees, taking to other food only when these are
scarce owing to clearing of the bush. In New Zealand they feed
on whatever the bush supplies them with, chiefly leaves and shoots.
Mr. F. Hunt, of Round Hill, says of them, “The food the opossum
lives on is chiefly leaves of broadleaf, kamahi, broad-gum (<i>Panax</i>),
and mapau (<i>Pittosporum</i>), rata-blossoms, supplejack-berries, berries
of fuchsia and makomako, and practically all the seeds and blossoms
that grow in this part of the bush. The opossum is not a grass-eating
animal. It will eat white or red clover, sweetbrier shoots
and seeds, but if an opossum is caged and fed on grass it will die of
starvation. Also, if it were fed on turnips it would take as much
to feed twelve opossums as one sheep would eat. When I and my
brother were catching opossums for the Southland Acclimatization
Society we fed them on carrots, boiled wheat, bread, boiled tea-leaves
with sugar, and anything sweet. The damage the opossums
would do running at large would be very little, seeing that they
never come on to open country. The animal is blamed for barking
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>apple-trees; but the opossum does not bark a tree. It might scratch
the bark with its teeth, but it does not strip it off.”</p>

<p>Colonel Boscawen, of Auckland, who is a most reliable authority,
tells me that as long as there is plenty of green stuff available
opossums do not interfere with fruit, but that the damage they
are often charged with is the work of rats&mdash;presumably black rats.
On the other hand, at Kawau, Motutapu, Hawera, and other places
they are stated to be destructive in orchards, eating the shoots of
apple and plum trees in the spring-time and the fruit in the
autumn.</p>

<p>The number of opossums in this country now is enormous. In
1912 it was estimated that over sixty thousand skins were taken in
the Catlin’s district alone. Some acclimatization societies try to
protect these animals, while fruitgrowers seek to destroy them. The
law is rather complex on the subject, and few laymen know whether
or not it is legal to destroy them. Meanwhile a large number are
killed annually; but their skins are often declared as rabbit-skins,
though, as a matter of fact, they are worth four or five times as
much.</p>

<h3>UNGULATA&mdash;WILD PIGS.</h3>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Most</span> people think they know all about pigs, and hardly associate
them with wild life in New Zealand. They usually consider them
the dirtiest creatures on earth, and yet, with remarkable inconsistency,
they eat ham and bacon without inquiring too particularly
how the animals producing them were reared or fed. The pig is
naturally one of the cleanest animals and most particular feeders
known, and it is only the filthy way in which most people keep
them which is responsible for their popular reputation.</p>

<p>Pigs are the commonest of the larger mammals which have
become feral in New Zealand, and are the most widespread. They
are plentiful in wild bush country from the North Cape to the
Bluff, and have also gone wild in the Chatham and Auckland
Islands. I hope to be able to tell the majority of my readers some
facts about these much-maligned animals which they did not know
before.</p>

<p>Pigs (<i>Sus scrofa</i>) belong to the section of Ungulates known as the
Artiodactyla, or even-toed. They walk on their third and fourth
toes, which are the only ones to reach the ground; those on each
side, which are much smaller and higher up, are the second and
fifth digits; there is no trace of the first. Pigs are distinguished
by several characters, of which the most outstanding are the bristly
skin, the flexible snout tipped by a fleshy disk within which the
nostrils open, the numerous teeth and tusk-like canines, while the
teats extend along the underside of the body. They possess a single
stomach, and are consequently non-ruminating animals. Pigs increase
at a great rate, for they commence to bear young when about
a year old, and bring forth several at a birth. Domestic pigs
produce twelve, or even more, at a time; but wild pigs seldom have
more than six or seven.</p>

<p>We have the most exact data as to their introduction into this
country. Captain Cook informs us that while he was in Queen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>Charlotte Sound in June, 1773, on his famous second voyage,
“Captain Furneaux put on shore, in Cannibal Cove, a boar and
two breeding-sows, so that we have reason to hope this country will,
in time, be stocked with these animals, if they are not destroyed
by the Natives before they become wild, for afterwards they will
be in no danger.”</p>

<p>Forster, in his journal, says, “They were turned into the woods
to range at their own pleasure.” In the following year (October,
1774) he says, “We took the opportunity to visit the innermost
recesses of West Bay, in order to be convinced, if possible, whether
there was any probability that the hogs brought thither about a
year before would ever stock those wild woods with numerous breeds.
We came to the spot where we had left them, but saw not the least
vestiges of their having been on the beach, nor did it appear that
any of the Natives had visited this remote place, from whence we
had reason to hope that the animals had retreated into the thickest
part of the woods.” Most probably this is what happened, and
these first pigs were probably the progenitors of many thousands.</p>

<p>On the 2nd November of the year 1773 Captain Cook gave
a few pigs to some Natives who came off in their canoes near Cape
Kidnappers. Thus pigs were first introduced into both the South
and North Islands of New Zealand. I do not think there is much
doubt that the wild pigs of the South Island&mdash;“Captain-Cookers,”
as they came to be called&mdash;were the progeny of those originally
set free at Cannibal Cove, though Cook himself recorded in 1777,
“I could get no intelligence about the fate of those I had left in
West Bay and in Cannibal Cove, when I was here in the course
of my last voyage.” There is an earlier record of the introduction
of pigs into the North Island, for in 1769 De Surville presented
the chief of the Natives at Doubtless Bay with two little pigs, but
there is no record as to what came of them.</p>

<p>The next introduction was apparently on the occasion of the
visit of Captain King, Governor of New South Wales, to the Bay
of Islands in 1793, when he gave the Natives two boars and ten
young sows. Dieffenbach, who was in New Zealand in 1839, but
who is not a reliable authority on any matters relating to Maori
stories or traditions, gives a different version of this gift. He
says, “Captain King, at the end of last century, landed at the
north end of the island, and gave the Natives three pigs, which,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>however, were mistaken by them for horses, they having some vague
recollection of those which they had seen on board Captain Cook’s
vessels. They forthwith rode two of them to death, and the third
was killed for having entered a burying-ground. A very old man
who had known Captain King related this singular story to me.”
Dieffenbach’s credulity seems to have been played on as regards
the horses, whatever approximation to truth there is in the other
part of the story; it is most improbable that any horses were on
board any of Cook’s ships.</p>

<p>The pigs introduced into the country in the early days were
evidently of more than one kind. Mr. R. Scott, formerly M.P. for
Central Otago, tells me that the wild pigs formerly so abundant in
this district were “originally a variety of the Tamworth breed&mdash;long-snouted,
razor-backed, built for speed rather than for fattening,
quick and agile in movement. The predominating colour was
red or sandy red, with some black, and a few black-and-white, but
these may have come from an occasional tame boar which strayed
and became wild. At the time when they were most numerous
in Otago they were decidedly gregarious, usually three or four
generations running together in mobs numbering from half a
dozen up to forty or even fifty. When attacked by dogs, if cover,
such as flax, scrub, or high grass, was handy, they made for it,
and would form a circle, with the older pigs on the outer ring
and the younger ones in the centre, for greater protection. The
boars, particularly the old ones, lived alone, and roamed far
and wide. The habits of the wild pig were clean.” The late
Mr. Robert Gillies wrote that “in 1848, the year of the settlement of
Otago, wild pigs were very common on the site of Dunedin.” In
1854 he and a party killed seventy pigs at the back of Flagstaff
Hill in two days. “The long, pointed snout, long legs, and
nondescript colours of the true wild pigs showed them to be
quite a different breed from the settlers’ imported pigs. Their
flesh tasted quite different from pork, being more like venison than
anything else.”</p>

<p>The wild pigs of the North Island were a different race from
the “Captain-Cookers,” and were probably the progeny of animals
imported at a later date. Dieffenbach says (in 1835), “The New
Zealand pigs are a peculiar breed, with short heads and legs, and
compact bodies.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>
<p>The increase of the wild pigs in pre-settlement days was very
remarkable. Nearly every sealing and whaling vessel which visited
these Islands between 1800 and 1830 took away quantities of pork
as part of the cargo to Sydney. Dr. Monro, who accompanied
Mr. Tuckett on his trip through Otago in 1844, speaking of the
hill country south-west of Saddle Hill, says, “There is a famous
cover for pigs, too, between the upper part of the Teiari [Taieri]
Valley and the sea. The whalers come up the river in their boats
and kill great numbers of pigs here.”</p>

<p>After settlement commenced and people started to cultivate
certain areas and to run sheep, wild pigs came to be looked
upon as animals to be killed out. Drummond tells us that “they
multiplied astonishingly, and enormous numbers assembled in uninhabited
valleys far from the settlements. At Wangapeka Valley,
in the Nelson Province, Dr. Hochstetter in 1860 saw several miles
ploughed up by pigs. Their extermination was sometimes contracted
for by experienced hunters, and he states that three men
in twenty months, on an area of 250,000 acres, killed no fewer than
twenty-five thousand pigs, and pledged themselves to kill fifteen
thousand more.”</p>

<p>At the present time wild pigs are still common in nearly all
scrub or thin bush country which is not too near settlement, and
to those who like the element of danger in their hunting they afford
good sport. They are usually pursued by dogs, often specially
trained for the purpose, which after a time succeed in bailing up
their prey. The pigs prefer to take their stand in the hollow of a
tree or some such locality, and an old boar will often do considerable
damage to the dogs before he is despatched. The orthodox manner
is to run in and stab him; but a man without a gun has little
chance if he ventures to close quarters with a bailed-up boar.</p>

<p>As to the food of the wild pigs, they root up the ground wherever
the bracken fern (<i>Pteris aquilina</i> var. <i>esculenta</i>) is found, the
starchy rhizomes furnishing abundant nutriment. They are also
very fond of the thick rootstocks of spear-grasses (<i>Aciphylla</i>) and
other umbelliferous plants, and have largely eaten out these plants
over large areas. In the Chatham Islands they have been mainly
responsible for exterminating the fine native forget-me-not, known
as the Chatham Island lily. In the Auckland Islands they have
destroyed great areas of <i>Bulbinella</i> and <i>Pleurophyllum</i>.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<h3>UNGULATA&mdash;DEER.</h3>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Exclusive</span> of horses and pigs, all the other ungulates which have
been introduced into New Zealand and have become established
here belong to the group of ruminants, or ruminating animals.
They are so called because they “ruminate”&mdash;that is, after the
food has been rapidly swallowed it is forced back up the gullet
and more thoroughly masticated. Belonging to this group we
have to deal with deer, oxen, goats, and sheep. These animals
agree in the following zoological characters: They have all two
digits or toes on the feet, which are therefore popularly known as
“cloven.” They have no upper incisor teeth, and the canines
in the upper jaw are frequently wanting. They are furnished
with horns&mdash;a very special characteristic&mdash;sometimes only on the
males, sometimes on both sexes. The stomach has four chambers.
The first is the large paunch, or rumen, the organ which in cattle
constitutes the well-known article of food termed “tripe.” This
opens into a smaller bag, the reticulum, or honeycomb bag, so
called on account of the network arrangement of the folds or ridges
of the mucous membrane which lines it. The reticulum opens into
the psalterium, or “many-plies,” a globular organ, the interior of
which is filled with folds, or laminae, which are arranged like the
leaves of a book, and very close together; hence both the technical
and popular names. The fourth chamber is the abomasum, or reed,
sometimes called the rennet-stomach. This is the stomach proper,
in which the digestion of the food is carried on, and it is the part
which when removed from calves is employed for the curdling of
milk.</p>

<p>Deer are distinguished from all other ruminants by the presence
of antlers, which in all our introduced forms occur in the males
only. These antlers are very interesting organs. In the commencement
of the spring a pair of knobs is to be seen upon the
forehead of the adult male animal. This is covered with a nearly
smooth dark skin, and a scar can be detected in the middle of
each, which is that left by the antler of the year before when it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>fell off. With advancing spring these knobs commence to grow, feel
warm to the touch, and sprout out, as it were, round the scar. One
branch takes a forward direction, whilst a second and larger one
makes its way backward. These become in the fully-formed antler
the brow-antler and the main beam. As long as the antler, which
is composed of genuine bone of very dense texture, is increasing
in size it is covered with the same warm, black skin as is the
knob from which it sprang, and as this skin is covered with short,
fine, close-set hair it has received the name of the “velvet.” It
is this velvet which secretes the bony texture of the antler from
its inner surface; therefore any mishap to it injures the growth
of the antler in the part affected. The animals, therefore, during
the time they are “in velvet” are more than usually careful to
protect their heads, and are inoffensive even to strangers. When
the antlers have ceased to grow, the velvet dries up, and the deer
rub their horns against any neighbouring trees and force them
into the soft earth until the membrane is quite rubbed off. Up
to this time they have lived a kind of solitary existence, but now
they go forth in their full vigour, seek out their future mates,
and fight any other stags which dare to dispute their ascendancy.</p>

<p>The desire to stock the mountain country of New Zealand with
large game, so that the Briton’s delight in going out to kill something
might be satisfied, has led to the introduction of no fewer
than nine kinds of deer, in addition to other large animals. Of
these, four species&mdash;fallow deer, red deer, sambur deer, and white-tailed
deer&mdash;have established themselves in different parts of the
country, and are included among the animals to shoot which
licenses are now issued. By law they are strictly preserved, but
much poaching has always been and still is done. At the same time,
it must be remembered that the poaching is chiefly done by two classes
of people&mdash;namely, by residents in the neighbourhood of the districts
where the game abound, and by mere pot-hunters. For the first class
it may be said that many farmers, who take no special interest in
acclimatization work or in so-called “sport,” who were not consulted
in any way on the subject, and who probably object to seeing
the undesirable game laws of the Old Country being reintroduced
here for the sake of a few wealthy people who are willing
to pay a price for the privilege of killing deer, naturally resent
the incursions of animals which ignore or break down their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>fences, harass their stock, and eat their hay and turnips. Therefore
some of this destruction of imported game takes the form of
reprisals for injury done to crops, fences, and stock. There is
practically little or no poaching, such as is characterized by the
name in the Mother-country, done on the property of private individuals,
and consequently destruction of game in New Zealand
is not looked upon as a heinous offence, as were breaches of the
iniquitous game laws of Britain in pre-war days. The game in
New Zealand is the property either of the State or of the acclimatization
societies, and public opinion on the subject of its destruction
is lax in comparison with what it is in countries where
game is looked upon as something reserved for and sacred to the
sporting instincts of a small, self-constituted, and select class.
Still, a very fair measure of protection is ensured to the animals,
and they have increased in many districts where they have been
liberated. It has been recognized, too, that a wealthy class of
tourists can be induced to visit the country if, in addition to
scenic attractions, there can be added those things which appeal to
the sporting instincts of humanity. This has led the Government
of the Dominion in recent years to devote some attention to the
subject of introducing various additional kinds of big game to
those already brought in by the acclimatization societies.</p>

<p>In addition to the four species already mentioned the following
kinds of deer have been introduced into this country:&mdash;</p>

<p>Sir George Grey liberated a pair of wapiti (<i>Cervus canadensis</i>)
in Kawau some time in the “seventies.” The doe died, and the
buck had to be killed, as he became dangerous. In 1905 the Tourist
Department obtained eighteen of these fine deer, which were designated
as “elk,” from America. Ten of these were a present
from President Roosevelt to the Government. These animals were
liberated at the head of Nancy Sound, on the south-west coast of
the South Island, and are now increasing in numbers.</p>

<p>In 1885 the Otago Acclimatization Society received three
Japanese deer (<i>Cervus nika</i>) from Mr. J. Bathgate, and they were
liberated on the Otekaike Estate, near Oamaru. Five years later
they were reported as “doing well and growing into a nice little
herd.” In the report for 1892 it is stated that “little or nothing
has been heard about these deer,” and nothing has been reported
since. Apparently they have all been destroyed.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>
<p>In 1905 the Tourist Department obtained six of these deer,
and liberated them on the Kaimanawa Ranges, near Taupo.
I have heard nothing further about them.</p>

<p>In 1905 the Government purchased five black-tailed (or mule)
deer (<i>Odocoileus hemionus</i>) in America, and liberated them at
Tarawera. In 1915 the Hawke’s Bay Society reported them as
increasing.</p>

<p>In 1870 the Auckland Acclimatization Society received three
South American deer (probably <i>Cariacus chilensis</i>) from Mr. W. A.
Hunt, but there is no further record of them.</p>

<p>The first attempt to introduce moose, or true elk (<i>Alches machlis</i>),
was made by the Government in 1900, when fourteen young ones
were shipped on board the “Aorangi” at Vancouver. Owing,
however, to the rough voyage, only four&mdash;two bulls and two cows,
nine months old&mdash;arrived in New Zealand. They were liberated
near Hokitika, but appear to have separated soon, as in 1903 one
cow was in one district, another at the gorge of the Hokitika
River, while nothing was known of the bulls. In 1913 the last-mentioned
cow was “in splendid condition, and as tame as a
kitten.” The others seem to have disappeared.</p>

<p>In 1910 the Government obtained ten moose, and these were
liberated on the shores of Dusky Sound. Two years later a mining
party found traces of both old and young moose, and the latest
reports show that the animals are increasing.</p>

<p>In 1867 the Otago Society imported seven axis deer, or chital
(<i>Cervus axis</i>), which were liberated in the Goodwood bush, near
Palmerston. In 1871 another stag was landed and added to the
herd, which at that time numbered about thirty. Ten years later
the Inspector reported that he had seen over forty. Then complaints
began to come in from the settlers round about that the deer were
a nuisance, and their numbers gradually diminished. Gradually
they were killed off, and none have been seen thereabouts for the
last twenty years.</p>

<p>In 1898 the Wellington Society received a pair of axis deer from
the Zoological Society of Calcutta, and placed them on Kapiti
Island, in Cook Strait. Four years later they had not increased,
and I have not heard of them since. In 1907 the Tourist Department
liberated five axis deer at Mount Tongariro, and in 1909 five
in Dusky Sound. No reports have as yet been received regarding
either of these latest experiments.</p>

<h3>UNGULATA&mdash;FALLOW, RED, AND SAMBUR DEER.</h3>


<h3><span class="smcap">Fallow Deer</span> (<i>Cervus dama</i>).</h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">On</span> account of its graceful form, beautiful colouring, and comparatively
inoffensive manner, this is the favourite deer for parks
and pleasure-grounds.</p>

<p>The fallow deer has palmated antlers&mdash;that is, they end in a
broad expansion, which is divided into several points, and has
been compared to a hand with its fingers. These antlers are not
developed at all in the fawn; in the second season they are simple
snags; in the third the two front branches develop; in the fourth
the extremity of the beam begins to assume the palmated form;
while the fully developed antler occurs only in the sixth year. It
is thus possible to tell the age of a buck by its antlers, and the
following terms have been used to distinguish the stags: Fawn,
pricket, sorrel, soare, buck of the first lead, and buck complete.
The antlers are usually cast about November, but I have no information
as to the dates in the different districts, and whether
the milder climate of the North Island causes any earlier development.
By the middle of February the new horns are almost free
from their velvet, and in about five months the antlers are complete.
The breeding (rutting) season begins about the middle of
April, when the bucks are occasionally heard to utter a sort of
grunting bark. This is the only kind of sound uttered by these
animals. A single fawn is born each year, usually in the month
of December.</p>

<p>Fallow deer are gregarious animals, going about in herds,
which consist of bucks by themselves, and of does and their fawns
by themselves. These herds coalesce in February and March,
and again&mdash;at least, in Britain&mdash;at the beginning of winter.
Sir Harry Johnston suggests that this winter gathering into large
herds is a relic of the days when they were forced to band together
in large numbers to protect themselves from the attacks of wolves
and other carnivorous beasts. It would be interesting to learn
whether this habit of winter aggregation is kept up in New Zealand.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>
<p>Fallow deer are of two main types. The first, which is rather
larger than the second, becomes a light reddish-grey or reddish-brown
in summer, spotted more or less brightly with white; the
legs and belly being cream-colour or pale buff. There is generally
a black line right down the centre of the back from the shoulder
to the end of the tail; the lower side of the tail and the rump under
it are white. In late autumn the fur changes in colour, the spots
disappear, and the fur on the upper part of the body becomes a
dark uniform brown. The buck of this variety stands about
36 in. high at the shoulder, sometimes a little more, while the
does are somewhat less.</p>

<p>In Britain there is a smaller type which is entirely without
spots, and which is not nearly as handsome as the other. I do not
know whether any of this type were introduced into New Zealand.
Most probably those brought here came from park herds, and these
are often very brightly coloured and spotted. It would be interesting
to learn what types we have in the country.</p>

<p>Fallow-deer venison is considered to be better and more juicy
than that of the red deer. In my opinion, venison is not equal to
mutton; but one has to bear in mind that when we eat venison we
are usually eating the flesh of bucks, or male animals, while we do
not eat the flesh of rams. If we did, and compared it with that of
deer, we might find cause to reverse our judgment. It is interesting
to note in old authors how greatly venison was esteemed, and it was
mostly fallow-deer venison which is referred to.</p>

<p>The first introduction of fallow deer into New Zealand was in
1864, when the Nelson Acclimatization Society received three from
England. All the early records of the Nelson Society are lost, so
we do not know what came of this experiment. Perhaps, however,
these animals were the originals of an old-established herd which
exists in that district.</p>

<p>In 1867 the Otago Society introduced two deer, in 1869 twelve
more, and in 1871 one. All these were liberated on the Blue
Mountains, Tapanui, where they have increased to a vast extent,
and now form one of the most important herds in the country.
Licenses to shoot them have been issued for over twenty-five years.</p>

<p>In 1871 the Canterbury Society had four fallow deer in their
gardens, but there is no record now obtainable as to where they
came from, nor definitely as to what was done with them. In later
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>years, however, some were running on the Culverden Estate, and
two more deer&mdash;obtained from Tasmania&mdash;were added to them.
This herd did not increase, and apparently they have all been
destroyed since.</p>

<p>The Hon. S. Thorne George, who lived on Kawau from 1869 to
1884, told me that the first fallow deer in the colony were introduced
there by his uncle, Sir George Grey, but he could not give the
exact date of their introduction. However, in 1876 the Auckland
Society received twenty-eight deer from London, and, of these,
eighteen were liberated on the Maungakawa Range, Waikato,
while ten were sent down to Wanganui. The former herd has
increased very largely, and is noted for the fine heads of the stags,
due, no doubt, to the abundance of food and the favourable
climatic conditions. The Wanganui herd is now also a large one.
On Motutapu, in the Hauraki Gulf, there is a very large herd,
which numbered over a thousand some three years ago. These
may either be descended from animals got from Kawau, or were
originally obtained from the Waikato herd. Smaller and more
recently established herds occur near Timaru, Hokitika, and Lake
Wakatipu; so it is seen that this species is widely spread throughout
New Zealand.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Red Deer</span> (<i>Cervus elaphus</i>).</h3>

<p>This handsome animal is found now in many parts of New
Zealand, forming great herds, some of which number many
thousand individuals. The red-deer stag is a lordly creature in
summer, standing over 4 ft. high at the shoulder, with a thickly
coated neck of greyish tint, a rich red-brown body-colour, uniformly
curved, symmetrical antlers, and a head held high. In winter
the coat is longer and of a greyish tint. The new-born calves are
brilliantly spotted with white, a character which this species shares
with many other kinds of deer. In some species, as in the axis
and fallow deer, the spots are retained in the adults, while in
the majority they are lost as the animals come to maturity. The
inference is that the progenitors of all these deer were spotted
animals; but this character has been lost in the course of time
by several species, though still retained in the young. The same
thing is seen among horses, newly-born foals often showing the
characteristic bars on the shoulders which are still found among
certain wild races of horses in the adult animals.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span></p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 3.&mdash;Red Deer (after Lydekker).</span></p>
</div>

<p>
<br />
</p>

<p>The antlers of the red deer are very complex. “In the spring
of the year following its birth the antlers are nothing more than
straight, conical, and unbranched ‘beams,’ the animal being then
known as a ‘brocket.’ In the following spring the antler has,
besides the ‘beam,’ a small branch from its base, directed forwards,
known as the ‘brow antler’; it is then termed ‘spayad.’
In the third year an extra front branch is formed, known as the
‘tres,’ and the whole antler is larger. This ‘tres’ is sometimes
seen in the smaller antler of the ‘spayad.’ In the fourth year the
‘brow-antler’ is doubled, to form the ‘brow’ and ‘bez-tine,’ at
the same time that the top of the main beam divides into the ‘sur-royals’
of the ‘staggard,’ or four-year male. In the fifth year
the ‘sur-royals’ become more numerous, the whole antler of the
‘stag’ being heavier than previously, only to be exceeded in weight
by those of the fully adult ‘great hart,’ with ten or more points,
each being larger and longer than the year before. In Britain the
conditions of life and food are not of the quality which develops
first-rate antlers; at the same time it is&mdash;in Scotland, at least&mdash;the
habit to shoot those with the finest heads, and so leave the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>indifferent specimens to perpetuate the species. In some of the
ancient forests of Germany superb herds of the red deer were to be
obtained [this was before the war, of course], whilst in several of the
old castles of that country antler trophies are preserved as memorials
of sport in times gone by with as many as six-and-sixty points.”</p>

<p>It is clear that there are several distinct strains of red deer
in the country, recognized chiefly by the form and growth of the
antlers, which are usually what sportsmen look to. This mixing of
breeds probably tends to the production of a strong race, and the
efforts of the main acclimatization societies are directed&mdash;often, it
must be admitted, rather blindly&mdash;to the elimination of defective
deer. In the case of some of the large herds attempts are frequently
made to thin out all weeds and deer with malformed antlers.
According to Mr. Hardcastle, the majority of malformations occur
in the skull and not merely in the horns, the horn-pedicle being
often misplaced. In Otago these malforms are most common in
open tussock land or open birch bush; they are not met with,
as a rule, in rugged gorges or in rough and dense bush country.
Perhaps malformation is due to want of nourishment at some period
of growth, but there is no definite information on the point, nor
is it known whether the trouble is hereditary or not.</p>

<p>The pairing season in New Zealand is in March or April, and
at that time the stags are dangerous creatures. They drop their
antlers usually about September, the youngest being the latest to do
so. The fawns are born in November or December, and the animals
continue to increase in bulk and strength till they are about twelve
years old. They probably do not live more than twenty years,
“though superstition credits them with very many more.”</p>

<p>Wherever they are abundant red deer live mostly on certain
trees and shrubs, and eat grass only when other food is not obtainable.
In the North Island it is stated that fuchsia is the
principal food in spring and autumn, but that in winter they
take to <i>Veronica salicifolia</i> (koromiko) and other shrubs. Probably
they eat the majority of the native shrubs. In the South Island
forests the following trees are mostly eaten: Broadleaf, species
of <i>Panax</i>, <i>Nothopanax</i>, <i>Coprosma</i>, ribbonwood, pepper-tree, milk-tree,
and tutu.<a name="Anchor_1" id="Anchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1.">[1]</a>
But when these are scarce they will eat almost any
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>shrub. They will not eat birch or beech (<i>Nothofagus</i>), nor celery-pine
(<i>Phyllocladus</i>), till other food is exhausted.</p>

      <a name="Footnote_1" id="Footnote_1" href="#Anchor_1" title="Return to text.">[1]</a><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;Tutu is not poisonous, but rather fattening, when animals become
        slowly accustomed to its use.
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

<p>The first specimens appear to have been brought&mdash;a pair of
them&mdash;to Nelson in 1851; but the doe was killed soon after, and
the buck, after remaining about Motueka for ten years, joined a
lot then introduced. In 1861 a stag and two hinds, presented by
Lord Petre from his park in Essex, England, were landed in
Nelson. The progeny of these animals increased, and rapidly
spread themselves over a great part of the high country in the
provincial districts of Nelson and Marlborough. Of late years
they have farther spread into North Canterbury and over towards
the West Coast. Mr. Hardcastle, who in 1906 wrote a report on
the red-deer herds in the country, says, “The heads obtained in
Nelson are of a good colour and fairly massive, but compared with
those of Wairarapa and Hawea they have not the same average
of span or spread. Lord Petre’s herd had had no new blood introduced
into it for many years, so that a particular type of
antler had been fixed from which there is no throwing back.”
According to Mr. Hardcastle, the type of head of the first imported
stag continues to persist, and dominates all the deer of the Nelson
herd. (In 1900 a herd, descended from Nelson deer, was started
in the Lillburn Valley, west of the Waiau River, in Southland.)</p>

<p>In 1862 a stag and two hinds, presented by the late Prince
Consort to Governor Weld, were handed over by him to Dr. Featherston,
then Superintendent of the Wellington Province, and were
liberated on the property of Mr. Carter, East Taratahi, Wairarapa.
They did not stay there long, however, but crossed into the
Maungaraki Range, where they rapidly increased. Mr. Hardcastle
reported in 1906, “The Wairarapa forest is probably the
best-stocked red-deer ground on the globe. On Te Awaite Run,
bordering on the east coast, the deer may now be seen in bunches
of up to one hundred head. At the beginning of last year it was
estimated that there were fully ten thousand head on the station.
According to information given in <i>The Field</i> of the 15th September,
1906, the Windsor Park herd, from which the original stock came,
has been replenished from English, Scottish, German, and probably
Danish stock. The result has produced in the Wairarapa herd
stags that are remarkable for their massive antlers, some of which
are of the German type, and others again more resembling the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>Scottish form. The antlers do not grow to great length, but some
are very wide in spread, and there is a great proportion of
‘Imperials,’ the most number of points recorded being twenty-two.
The stags mature their antlers early. A number of heads
have been shot on Te Awaite Station showing the abnormal development
of the back tines, such as is seen to be the case in the great
Warnham Park stags in England, and which is probably due to the
highly favourable conditions of climate, food, and shelter.”</p>

<p>In 1871 the Otago Acclimatization Society imported fifteen red
deer, some of which were sent to the care of Mr. Rich, of Bushy
Park, Palmerston; while seven were liberated on the Morven Hills
Run, east of Lake Hawea. Those at Bushy Park spread over into
the Horse Range; but they did not succeed, and no definite explanation
of the failure has been given. Probably the country was
not high and wild enough: on one side they were encroaching
all the time on well-stocked sheep-country, and on the other on
old-settled farm land; besides which there were many old diggers
still about the neighbourhood. From one cause or another they
did not succeed. The Otago Acclimatization Society reported them
as quite extinct in 1892, but Mr. Hardcastle, writing in 1918, says
they are still to be found on the Horse Range.</p>

<p>The deer liberated at Morven Hills were from the estates of
the Earl of Dalhousie, in Forfarshire, Scotland. They are the
only lot of pure Scottish-bred deer in this country. In their new
home in the New Zealand mountains they multiplied at a great
rate, and have in these forty-odd years spread over the country
between Lakes Wanaka, Hawea, and Ohau. They have worked
their way up the Hunter and Makarora Rivers, across the Haast
Pass into south Westland, and right up to the neighbourhood of
Mount Cook. The most of this country runs from 3,000 ft. to
7,000 ft. in height, and much of it is very steep, rugged, and
inaccessible. But it contains much bush in the valleys and gullies,
and the open country is well grassed in summer. Hardcastle says,
“The North Otago stags maintain the true Scottish type of antler,
but they grow to much greater length than the antlers of any stags
that have been shot in the British Isles. The antlers are also
remarkable for their symmetry and perfection in the development
of the tines, and particularly the lower tines. Some magnificent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>heads have been got, including a seventeen-and an eighteen-pointer,
and two royals, each 46 in. in length of antlers; more recently a
head 49 in. in length with a spread of 50&frac12; in., and either one or
two with twenty points, have been obtained. The coats of the stags
are generally shaggy, owing, no doubt, to the severe climate in
winter.”</p>

<p>In 1895 the Otago Society obtained two fine stags from the Hunt
Club, Melbourne, to add to the North Otago herd; but I do not
know what special strain these belonged to. Again, in 1913, the
society imported a stag and six hinds from Warnham Park, England,
the object in both cases being to introduce new blood into the
herds.</p>

<p>In 1897 the Canterbury Acclimatization Society imported nine
red deer from the Warnham Park herd, and liberated them in the
gorge of the Rakaia River. They have increased rapidly since,
herds of forty and more having been seen from time to time. Some
of the heaviest heads secured in New Zealand have been got from
this herd. The record length head from this herd is 48&frac12; in.; the
record spread is 46&frac34; in.; and the record points twenty-four. The
heaviest heads shot in New Zealand have been obtained in the
Rakaia Gorge herd, a number of dry skulls and horns from thence
weighing from 22 lb. to 23&frac34; lb. Mr. Hardcastle, my informant,
states that he does not think more than an odd head going as much
as 20 lb. has been shot in any other herd in New Zealand.</p>

<p>More recent importations have been as follows: In 1903 either
seven or eight fawns from Victoria, presented by Miss Audrey
Chirnside, of Werribee Park, were liberated at Mount Tuhua, in
Westland. In 1906 four more from the same source were added to
this herd; and eight were liberated at Lake Kanieri. In 1903
the Tourist Department obtained eight deer from the Duke of
Bedford, and liberated them at Lake Wakatipu. In 1908 four
were obtained from Warnham Park, Sussex, England, and were
liberated at Paraparaumu. In 1909 three were liberated at Dusky
Sound.</p>

<p>The original importations of red deer account for the vast
numbers of these animals which are now to be met with in so
many mountainous parts of both Islands, for many of the acclimatization
societies, as well as the Tourist Department, have obtained
deer from one or other of these original herds, and have
started new herds in other districts&mdash;for example, in the country
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>round Taupo and Rotorua, the West Coast Sounds of the South
Island, and Stewart Island&mdash;and these are all increasing. In
regard to the last-mentioned locality, a conflict has now arisen
between the would-be sportsmen of the Southland Acclimatization
Society and those who desire to see the rare native bird fauna of
Stewart Island preserved. It is to be hoped that no shooting of
game will be allowed in the island.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Sambur Deer, or Sambar</span> (<i>Cervus unicolor</i>).</h3>

<p>This is a handsome deer from the hill-country of India. The
stag stands about 5 ft. high, is of a deep-brown colour, with the hair
of the neck developed almost into a mane. It is massively built,
and carries great antlers over 3 ft. in length, and presenting three
powerful points. Above the considerable brow-tine the beam
bifurcates high up into two fairly equal snags, and no more, in
well-grown antlers. The hind is much less massive, and of a
yellowish tint. Captain Kinloch says of the species that “Sambur
delights in stony hills where there is plenty of cover, and where
they can have easy access to water. They browse more than graze,
and are nearly nocturnal in their habits. During the daytime
they seek the most shady retreats, and old stags especially are most
difficult to find, frequently betaking themselves to almost inaccessible
places, where the uninitiated would never dream of looking
for them.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<a name="sambur" id="sambur"><img src="images/sambur_i_035.jpg" alt="sambur" width="700" height="464" /></a>
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 4.&mdash;Sambur Deer (after Lydekker).</span></p>
</div>

<p>
<br />
</p>

<p>The introduction of sambur into New Zealand is difficult to
trace. In 1875 the Auckland Acclimatization Society received a
buck from a Mr. Larkworthy, and in the following year a doe, but
there is no further mention of these deer in the society’s reports.
However, in the annual report of the Wellington Society for 1894
the following statement occurs: “The Ceylon elk (sambur deer)
imported into the Carnarvon district, Manawatu, by Mr. Larkworthy
have been brought under the provisions of the Animals
Protection Act, and are at present under the control of the society.
It has been reported that the herd now numbers about thirty.”
There is no previous record of these deer in the Wellington
Society’s reports. In 1900 the herd is reported to number about
a hundred, “but there is good reason to think that they are really
more numerous.... A pair of antlers was found on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>hills near Cambridge, and two deer were shot there,” some two
hundred miles from Carnarvon. In 1906 stag-shooting was opened
for the first time in the Marton district (Rangitikei), but there were
numerous complaints about poaching. The herd seems now to be
a fairly large one, but the local Rangers complain of indiscriminate
destruction of deer in season and out of season.</p>

<p>In 1907 the Tourist Department imported two sambur deer from
Noumea, and liberated them in the Rotorua district, adding to
them some others secured in the Manawatu, so as to form the nucleus
of a new herd.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Virginian or White-tailed Deer</span> (<i>Cariacus virginianus</i>).</h3>

<p>In 1905 the Tourist Department imported eighteen white-tailed
deer from America, and liberated nine of them at Port
Pegasus, in Stewart Island, and nine in the Rees Valley, Lake
Wakatipu. The former location should not have been chosen,
for Stewart Island was long ago proclaimed a sanctuary for
native birds, and its selection illustrates the haphazard way in
which acclimatization work has been carried on in this country.
The introduction and the location were both apparently the choice
of Mr. Donne, of the Tourist Department, who is now in London.
These deer have increased to such an extent that in October,
1919, regulations for shooting them were gazetted, which means
that the island will cease to be a sanctuary. The white-tailed
deer is about 3 ft. high. The upper part of the body is a bright
chestnut colour in summer, changing to a yellowish speckled
grey in winter, and with black markings on the face and tail.
The distinctive feature, from which the popular name is derived,
is the white colour of the underside of the tail. The antlers are
rather large, up to 14 in. or more between the tips, and have as
many as eighteen points in the largest specimens. I do not know
whether they are very numerous in Port Pegasus, while there is no
information available about the herd in the Lake Wakatipu region.</p>

<h3>UNGULATA&mdash;WILD CATTLE, SHEEP, AND GOATS.</h3>


<h3><span class="smcap">Wild Cattle.</span></h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> animals which form the group called the Bovidae (from the
Latin <i>bos</i>, an ox), including cattle, sheep, goats, and their allies,
differ in several respects from Cervidae, or deer. One of the most
important differences is the structure of the horns. Those of the
Bovidae are hollow and permanent, while the antlers of deer are
made of solid bone and are deciduous, being renewed each year.</p>

<p>The wild cattle of New Zealand are (like the wild pigs) only
domesticated animals which have been running in unfenced country
for several generations back. They are not nearly so abundant
to-day as they were forty or fifty years ago. In these earlier days
most of the cattle on the larger runs&mdash;to whatever breed they
belonged&mdash;were more or less wild. They became greatly excited
when they saw a man on foot, for they were mostly accustomed to
men on horseback, to whom they gave only a passing notice. When
mobs of such half-wild cattle were to be yarded, either for branding
of calves or for drafting, they were handled pretty roughly. On
enclosed roads they were dangerous, and even in open country the
presence of people on foot scared and often scattered them. It is
no wonder that when such cattle got into wild country where they
were undisturbed and never saw human beings they and their
progeny quickly became quite wild. When I first came to Southland,
about fifty years ago, we were bothered a good deal by wild
cattle. They found shelter during severe winter weather in the
extensive bush country which formed such a feature of Southland
in those days, and they used to come into our paddocks overnight.
Fences and ditches never troubled them: they hopped over them
as if they were non-existent. In the open country it was impossible
to approach them on foot, while even on horseback one had
to make a wide circuit to get within range of them. The gradual
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>settlement and enclosure of the land displaced them in time, and
they are now found chiefly in distant and seldom-visited parts.</p>

<p>It is difficult to find exact records of the introduction of cattle
into New Zealand. They were no doubt brought over by the
missionaries, and also by the whalers who settled along the coast.
Thus in 1833 John Bell set out from Sydney for Mana Island, in
Cook Strait, with ten head of cattle and 102 sheep. Apart from
a reference in Marsden’s journal to the landing of some cattle, this
is the first record I can find since the days of Cook and Vancouver.
In 1839 E. J. Wakefield saw wild cattle on the hills at the entrance
of Pelorus Sound. In 1840 he states that they were abundant on
Kapiti, and says that they were the descendants of some which
were given to the Natives in exchange for flax. The Hon. S. Thorne
George, writing to me four years ago, said, “When I first went to
Kawau, in 1869, there was a large number of wild cattle. The
island was originally occupied as a cattle-station, but owing to the
rough country and heavy bush very many were lost and became
quite wild.” Mr. A. C. Yarborough, of Kohukohu, informs me
that forty years ago wild cattle were very numerous in all the bush
country, and in those days Hokianga and the large areas of the west
coast of the Island north of Auckland were nearly all covered with
bush. The Natives used to kill them in large quantities for the
sake of their hides, which were valued at 6s. to 12s. each. In later
years these wild cattle have been driven farther and farther back,
until they are now found only in the ranges distant from settlement.
These cattle are merely the descendants of tame ones which
have wandered, the Maoris’ fences being usually of a defective
character.</p>

<p>The wild cattle of these early days were an extremely mixed lot,
and it is hard to say to what breed they were most nearly allied.
Shorthorns, Ayrshire, and Polled Angus were commonly mixed in
the South Island, but all sorts of strains were represented.</p>

<p>Mr. B. C. Aston, who crossed over part of the Wellington
district in 1914 and 1915, says, “Wild cattle are abundant in
unfrequented valleys and gorges of the Tararua Range. They are
apparently Hereford cattle gone wild. They eat out many species
of native plants, and have destroyed great numbers of <i>Ligusticum
dissectum</i>, which is one of the most abundant and characteristic
plants of the higher ground.” He adds that cattle are particularly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>fond of certain native trees and shrubs, such as hinahina,
karamu, broadleaf, mangrove, tawa, and karaka. I myself noticed
in Ulva, in Paterson Inlet, forty years ago, that the only winter
food for the cows was hinahina and similar small trees, which had
to be cut down for them. My son Stuart informs me that wild
cattle are found in the high country between Lake Wakatipu and
the west coast of the South Island; their tracks are numerous, for
example, in the valley of the Rockburn.</p>

<p>In 1841 cattle were first introduced into the Chatham Islands.
Many of them soon became wild, and used to be trapped by the
Natives in the early “sixties.” Wild cattle are now very numerous
in the central tableland.</p>

<p>In 1850 cattle were landed on the Auckland Islands, but they
were all killed off by sealers. In 1894 cattle were landed from
the “Hinemoa” at Enderby and Rose Islands for the use of
shipwrecked mariners who were unfortunate enough to be cast
ashore on these inhospitable shores. Dr. Cockayne tells me that
in 1903 there were about fifteen and ten head respectively on these
two islands, and Mr. B. C. Aston adds that on Enderby Island
they have exterminated the huge tussocks of <i>Poa litorosa</i>.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Wild Sheep.</span></h3>

<p>The first attempt to introduce sheep into New Zealand was made
by Captain Cook during his second voyage to this country. It
was unsuccessful, but the record is interesting. He brought away
two rams and four ewes from the Cape of Good Hope, but by the
time the “Resolution” entered Dusky Sound in March, 1773, only
a ram and a ewe survived, and they were in such a bad state,
“suffering from an inveterate sea-scurvy,” that their teeth were
loose, and they could not eat the green food which was given to
them. Forster in his journal states that they “were in so wretched
a condition that their further preservation was very doubtful.”
However, they must have improved, for, considering the country
about Dusky Sound too rough and forest-clad for them, Cook took
them on to Queen Charlotte Sound, which was entered on the 18th
May. In his journal he says, “On the 22nd, in the morning, the
ewe and ram I had with so much care and trouble brought to
this place were both found dead, occasioned, as was supposed,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>by eating some poisonous plant. Thus my hopes of stocking this
country with a breed of sheep were blasted in a moment.” Most
probably they had eaten tutu, which is common in the Marlborough
Sounds district.</p>

<p>I cannot find when sheep were next brought into New Zealand,
but as soon as settlement began they were freely imported from
New South Wales. In those early days fences were very rough,
and little or no attempt was made to keep sheep within enclosures.
They were therefore allowed to roam freely over the open country,
and were mustered at only rare intervals for shearing, tailing the
lambs, culling, &amp;c. It was inevitable, therefore, that numbers
escaped the musterers, especially in high and inaccessible country,
and that thus wild sheep became very common in the mountainous
districts of the South Island.</p>

<p>Wild sheep are still abundant in some of the wilder parts of
the country, and are especially numerous in the high limestone
country of Marlborough. Much of this country is a <i>terra incognita</i>,
for it is most inaccessible, except in certain rare states
of the river-gorges, and very few people know anything about it.
Mr. Aston, who recently visited this region on a botanical quest,
says, “On the north-west side of Isolated Hill is a gently sloping
tussock-land, stretching down towards the Ure River, on which
are hundreds of wild sheep in small flocks of about half a dozen
in each. All&mdash;rams, ewes, and particularly the lambs&mdash;are, as
far as we could see, in excellent condition. Some were curiously
marked and coloured. One had a brown body, black legs and face,
and white forehead. The rams had large horns, and all were tamer
than ordinary domestic sheep. Their food appears to consist of
the silver-tussock (<i>Poa caespitosa</i>)&mdash;which was well eaten down&mdash;spear-grass,
and several other native plants and shrubs.” In
another part of his account he adds, “These sheep destroy the
mountain-ribbonwood trees (<i>Gaya Lyallii</i>) by eating the bark,
which we watched one stripping off in large sheets.”</p>

<p>In the district of Strath Taieri, in Otago, some forty years ago
certain sheep on one of the runs&mdash;probably the progeny of a single
ram&mdash;were found to be evidently short-winded. Apparently the
action of the heart was defective, for when these sheep were driven
they would run with the rest of the flock for a short distance, and
then lie down panting. The result of this peculiar affection was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>that at nearly every mustering these short-winded sheep used to
be left behind, being unable to be driven with the rest. Sometimes
they were brought on more slowly afterwards, but if it happened
to be shearing-time they were simply caught and shorn where they
lay. As a result of this peculiar condition a form of artificial
selection was set up, the vigorous, active sheep being constantly
drafted away for sale, &amp;c., while this defective strain increased
with great rapidity throughout the district, for whenever the mobs
were mustered for the market, shearing, or drafting, these “cranky
sheep,” as they came to be called, were left behind.</p>

<p>This defective character appeared in every succeeding generation,
and seemed to increase in force, reminding one of the Ancon
sheep referred to by Darwin. At first, of course, the character was
not recognized as hereditary, but as the numbers of this “cranky”
breed increased to a very great extent, and spread over the district,
it came at last to be recognized as a local variety. When the runs
on which these sheep were abundant were cut up and sold, or released
in smaller areas, the purchasers found it necessary, for the
protection of their own interests, to exterminate the variety, of
which hundreds were found straggling over the country. This was
easily and effectively done in the following manner: As soon as a
sheep of this variety was observed it was pursued, but after running
for a couple of hundred yards at a great rate of speed it would
drop down panting behind a big stone or other shelter, and seemed
incapable for a time of rising and renewing its flight. It was
immediately destroyed, and in this manner a useless&mdash;but to the
naturalist a very interesting&mdash;variety was eliminated.</p>

<p>Sheep were introduced into the Chatham Islands in the early
“forties,” but as late as 1855 there were only about two hundred
of them. When sheep-stations were organized in 1866 there were
about two thousand on the island, and by 1900 they had increased
to about sixty thousand, and by this time a great many had become
wild. Dr. Cockayne says they have profoundly altered the native
vegetation by eating out many characteristic species of plants, such
as <i>Myosotidium nobile</i>, <i>Aciphylla Traversii</i>, <i>Veronica Dieffenbachii</i>,
and allied species, all of which they eat greedily.</p>

<p>On the Auckland Islands sheep have been liberated at various
times since 1890, and on the Antipodes between 1886 and 1900,
for the benefit of shipwrecked mariners, but they either died off
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>or were killed by castaways. They were also liberated on Campbell
Island between 1888 and 1890. In 1896 the island was taken up
as a sheep-run&mdash;a piece of vandalism on the part of the men who
did it and the Government which granted it&mdash;and in 1903 there
were about 4,500 sheep on it. The changes produced in the vegetation
have been described and discussed at length by Dr. Cockayne.
In 1907, according to Mr. R. M. Laing, there were some eight
thousand sheep on the island, and the transformation and destruction
of the native flora was going on at a great rate.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Wild Goats.</span></h3>

<p>The introduction of goats dates from Captain Cook’s second
voyage. He says in his journal, “On June 2, 1773, I sent on
shore on the east side of the sound [Queen Charlotte Sound] two
goats, male and female. The former was something more than
a year old, but the latter was much older. She had two fine kids
some time before we arrived in Dusky Bay, which were killed by
cold.” Forster in his journal says they were left by Captain
Furneaux in an unfrequented part of East Bay, “this place
being fixed on in hopes that they would there remain unmolested
by the Natives, who, indeed, were the only enemies they had to
fear.”</p>

<p>On the third voyage the “Resolution” was in Queen Charlotte
Sound from the 12th to the 25th February, 1777, and Captain Cook
says, “I gave Matahouah two goats (a male and a female with kid)
and to Tomatongeauooranuc two pigs (a boar and a sow). They
made me a promise not to kill them, though I must own I put no
great faith in this. The animals which Captain Furneaux sent
on shore here, and which soon after fell into the hands of the
Natives, I was now told were all dead.”</p>

<p>It is popularly believed that the wild goats of New Zealand
are descended from those introduced by Captain Cook; but while
this may be partly true of those in the South Island, especially at
its northern end, it can hardly explain those found in the North
Island. It is more likely that they are descended from escaped
animals. Mr. F. G. Gibbs tells me that goats were imported into
Nelson some time in the “forties.” “In the ‘fifties’ a large
number were kept tethered on some hills in the Maitai Valley, still
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>called the Goat Hills. Some of these goats escaped into the back
country, and were the progenitors of the wild goats.”</p>

<p>Wild goats are very abundant in many parts of New Zealand.
Great numbers of them are to be met with in the rocky and precipitous
country west of Palliser Bay, near Wellington. Except
when they move they are difficult to see, as their colours blend
almost undistinguishably with that of their natural surroundings.
They were abundant also on Kapiti Island, but have recently been
greatly reduced in number by the caretaker, who has shot several
thousands. They also occur, though not so commonly, on the
sparsely scrub-clad faces of the west coast north and south of
Hokianga, as well as on the outskirts of bush land. In the high
country of Marlborough they are very abundant, and are mainly
of three colours&mdash;black (which is, perhaps, the commonest), khaki,
and white. In a trip through the cañon of the Ure River Mr. B. C.
Aston says, “The fusillades of stones showered down on us by
the goats which we had disturbed were a source of ever-present
danger.” Mr. W. R. Bullen, of Kaikoura, informs me that they
are numerous on his run, but, while they eat very much the same
food as the sheep do, they keep the scrub and bush open, so that
the sheep can move through it.</p>

<p>Writing of things in the Lake Wakatipu district, Mr. L. Hotop,
of Queenstown, tells me that there is an immense number of wild
goats spread all over the Lakes district&mdash;a moderate estimate gives
them as many as thirty thousand. “They are principally at
Moonlight, Skipper’s, Sandhills, and at the lower end of the lake,
seriously interfering with the pasturage in these localities; one
runholder has paid year after year for as many as one thousand
during the season. At Moonlight a digger, during the past nine
months [in 1916], has shot 550. My informant tells me he was
offered 2s. 3d. a skin for as many as he could send.”</p>

<p>Mr. W. H. Gates, of Skipper’s, writing in 1916, said, “There
are a lot of wild goats here, almost within rifle-range of my cabin.
One sheep-farmer gave 1s. for each pair of ears, and 1s. for each
pelt. The male is a rough-looking customer; some have horns
15 in. in length and 2&frac12; in. by 1&frac34; in. at the root, and they grow in
a slightly spiral form. I think there is a strain of many breeds
running through them all. Some have long hair, but are not the
Angora breed. Some are almost white, but the chief colours are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>black-and-white or black-and-tan. I have noticed here (and also
on the west coast) that the female has her young in the winter, when
food is not plentiful. Why this is so I never could understand.”</p>

<p>Goats are still found wild on the Galloway Station, Central
Otago, though not so abundantly as in former years. They live
in the high country, and do not come down to the settlements.
Mr. A. Gunn, who managed this large run for many years, tells
me that they are of great use to sheep-farmers, as they keep down
the “lawyers” (<i>Rubus australis</i>), and thus save the sheep from
being entangled. In shooting them, if the wind is coming from
their direction, you can smell them before you see them; and a
billygoat is always found standing on guard while they are feeding.
While they are of many colours, black-and-white is the commonest,
though brownish-red, grey, and even occasionally a white
one is found. They live in the roughest places they can find.</p>

<p>Goats are also found in considerable numbers round the south-east
corner of the South Island, but whether they have escaped
from the settlements about Preservation Inlet or have worked
overland from Southland it is not possible to say with certainty.
Probably the former is the explanation of their occurrence from
Puysegur Point inland.</p>

<p>The attempts made from time to time to acclimatize goats on
the outlying Southern Islands are of interest. Captain Enderby
landed some on Enderby Island in 1850, and Captain Norman
landed them on both the Auckland and Enderby Islands in 1865,
but none appear to have survived. Dr. Cockayne says, “Two or
three were landed on Ewing Island in 1895, but none have been
seen recently. On Ocean Island, a very small islet in the Auckland
Group, goats are numerous at the present time, but I have
no details as to how they got there.” Captain Bollons, of the
“Hinemoa,” writing me in February, 1916, speaks also of the
last-named island, and adds, “Goats have been sent down from time
to time to the Auckland Islands since 1890, most of which have
either died or been killed off for food by castaways. At the Snares
they were liberated about 1889, but soon died off. At Campbell
Island some were landed in 1883 and 1890, and several were alive
when the main island was taken up for a sheep-run in 1896. At
the Antipodes several were liberated between 1886 and 1900, but
were either used for food by the castaways or died off.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Other Species of Bovidae.</span></h3>

<p>The Tourist Department has in recent years introduced various
species of large game into New Zealand. Thus a small number
of thar, or Himalayan goats (<i>Capra jemlaica</i>), are now running
wild on the Sealey Range, near Mount Cook. Apparently they are
increasing rapidly.</p>

<p>Chamois are also increasing in the neighbourhood of Mount
Cook. The first were introduced in 1907, when eight were received
as a present from the late Emperor of Austria. By latest accounts
there is now a considerable flock in that mountain region.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<h3>CETACEA&mdash;WHALES, DOLPHINS, AND PORPOISES.</h3>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">How</span> little any of us in New Zealand know about the monsters of
the deep which are to be met with in the seas round our coasts!
I seldom meet with any one who knows anything about them, or
who can furnish me with anything beyond the merest shreds of
information. I myself have seen a few whales and dolphins, and
numerous porpoises; and this is the experience of all who travel
by sea and care to observe its wonders. But such observers are
few. Most of those whose business takes them on the great waters
are concerned with other things than the animal life which the
sea contains; and even fishermen, whose occupation takes them
out constantly among this animal life, can give little information
which is of the slightest value on anything but fishes.</p>

<p>Whales and their allies are not fishes, but are warm-blooded
mammals, which suckle their young, and which breathe air&mdash;not
dissolved oxygen, as fishes do. They constitute the order Cetacea.
Twenty or more species are met with in New Zealand seas. Of
these many are most imperfectly known, and several are only
recognized by their bones.</p>

<p>Zoologically cetaceans are fish-like mammals, which have the tail
expanded into horizontal flukes, the anterior limbs converted into
fin-like paddles, and the posterior limbs represented by some rudimentary
bones. Their bodies are nearly quite destitute of hair,
and, as they have to breathe air, their nostrils are represented by
a single or double blowhole, which is nearly always situated far
back upon the skull. Some of the order have simple conical teeth;
others have the jaws furnished with plates of baleen, or whalebone.</p>

<p>Whales include the largest of all vertebrate animals, but their
reputed measurements, like those of many fish, have to be received
with a grain of salt. The largest whales are the Rorquals, and
perhaps 85 ft. is about the maximum recorded length. Compare
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>that with the biggest dray-horse or the prize fat bullock at a show,
and then try to realize what a huge bulk it is.</p>

<p>The whalebone-whales are well represented in New Zealand
waters, though individuals are now rare compared with their relative
abundance a century ago. A Norwegian company which
started operations on a large scale in the North Island a few years
ago abandoned the enterprise after trying it for a year or two.
There was not enough money in it. Yet whalebone is enormously
valuable&mdash;it was worth £2,000 a ton twenty years ago, and, in spite
of numerous substitutes, it still keeps its place.</p>

<p>The Fin-back, or Rorqual (<i>Balaenoptera musculus</i>), runs up
to 70 ft. in length, and yet its food seems to consist chiefly of
small pelagic crustaceans belonging to the Copepoda. These little
creatures, which can be taken by a fine-mesh surface net at all
seasons of the year, vary from one-tenth to one-fortieth of an inch
in length. It would be a somewhat difficult calculation to find
how many of these little creatures would be required to assuage
the appetite of a hungry whale. The whale has about 330 baleen
plates on each side of its jaw, and these act as strainers to catch
the little crustaceans. The production and destruction of inconceivable
myriads of organisms are among the extraordinary and
awe-inspiring phenomena of the sea.</p>

<p>Two other species of <i>Balaenoptera</i> are the Blue Whale (<i>B. sibbaldii</i>),
which has been taken 85 ft. in length&mdash;the giant of its race&mdash;and
the Pike Whale (<i>B. rostrata</i>), which seldom exceeds 30 ft.</p>

<p>The Humpback Whale (<i>Megaptera lalandii</i>) is so called because
it has a lowish hump on its back, which represents the dorsal fin.
Its maximum length is probably 60 ft. None of these whales,
which are species with a very wide geographical distribution, are
of much commercial value.</p>

<p>Of the “right” whales&mdash;which are merely the right kind of
whales for the whaler to pursue, as their whalebone is longer and
more valuable, and their oil more abundant and superior in
quality to that of the other species named&mdash;the most important is
the Southern Right Whale (<i>Balaena australis</i>). This animal is
world-wide in its distribution, occurring in all seas but the
Arctic regions, where its place is taken by the Greenland Whale
(<i>B. mysticetus</i>).</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span></p>
<p>Allied to this is the Little Australian Whale (<i>Neobalaena
marginata</i>), which occurs only in the ocean south of New Zealand
and Australia, and which grows only about 16 ft. long.</p>

<p>The most important of all these animals from a commercial
point of view is the Sperm Whale, or Cachalot, an animal 60 ft.
to 70 ft. in length&mdash;nearly one-third of it head&mdash;which used to
be common in these southern seas, though mainly an inhabitant
of warmer regions. The specific name&mdash;<i>Physeter macrocephalus</i>&mdash;refers
to its gigantic head. The mouth is ventral in position, and
the lower jaw is furnished with a great row of teeth, and according
to Frank Bullen, who gives a picture of it, the animal turns over
on its back like a shark when it is going to bite. I cannot vouch
for the accuracy of this statement.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<a name="sperm" id="sperm"><img src="images/sperm_i_049.jpg" alt="sperm" width="700" height="338" /></a>
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 6.&mdash;Sperm Whale, or Cachalot.</span></p>
</div>

<p>
<br />
</p>

<p>These animals are still fairly common, though they are persistently
and unremittingly pursued for their destruction. Bullen,
writing of Foveaux Strait in the “nineties,” says, “Only three
days elapsed after our arrival when whales were seen. For the
first time I realized how numerous these gigantic denizens of the
sea really are. As far as the eye could reach, extending all round
one-half of the horizon, the sea appeared to be alive with spouts&mdash;all
sperm whales, all bulls of great size. The value of this incredible
school must have been incalculable. Subsequent experience
satisfied me that such a sight was by no means uncommon here&mdash;in
fact, ‘lone whales’ or small ‘pods’ were quite the exception.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span></p>
<p>The cavity lying below the skull in the great square head of
this whale is filled with spermaceti, which is fluid fat during the
life of the animal. Up till as late as the middle of the eighteenth
century this oil was regarded as the brain of the cachalot. The
most valuable product yielded by the Sperm Whale is ambergris,
which is a product of the intestinal canal. When first extracted
it has a greasy feel and consistency, and then as it hardens it
acquires its characteristic sweet, earthy odour. It is occasionally
found floating at sea or washed up on beaches, and it is extraordinary
how constantly lumps of fat or tallow thrown overboard
by passing vessels get picked up on the shore and are eagerly
seized by the finders, who think they have discovered a treasure.
I have had numbers of such finds brought to me for identification.
They nearly always turned out to be chunks of mutton-fat. The
value of ambergris is very problematical&mdash;anywhere from 5s.
to 10s. per ounce, probably. As far as I know, it is used only in
connection with perfumery.</p>

<p>Professor Beddard says of the Sperm Whale, “Its food is chiefly
cuttlefishes, and it is said to have a predilection for those colossal
cuttlefishes whose existence has until recently been doubted. Mr.
Bullen has sketched a conflict between these two giants of the deep.
On the other hand, it is said that its large throat, more than big
enough to swallow a man (this whale is credited with being that
which swallowed Jonah) does not usually admit fishes larger than
bonitos and albacores.” Bullen’s account of this fight is worth
reading by all interested in these creatures. It is, of course, unsubstantiated,
and the illustration which accompanies it is in part
imaginary and taken from the description. But the account is probably
correct, and the fact of their choice of food is well authenticated.
In another part of his work, describing the contents of the
mouth of a captured Sperm Whale, he writes: “In the maw there
were, besides a large quantity of dismembered squid of great size,
a number of fish, such as rock-cod, barracouta, snapper, and the
like, whose presence there was a revelation to me. How in the
name of wonder so huge and unwieldy a creature as the cachalot
could manage to catch those nimble members of the finny tribe
I could not for the life of me divine! Unless&mdash;and after much
cogitation it was the only feasible explanation that I could see&mdash;as
the cachalot swims about with his lower jaw hanging down in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>its normal position, and his huge gullet gaping like some submarine
cavern, the fish unwittingly glide down it, to find egress impossible.
This may or may not be the case; but I, at any rate, can find no
more reasonable theory, for it is manifestly absurd to suppose the
whale capable of catching fish in the ordinary sense, indicating
pursuit.”</p>

<p>Whaling was a most profitable industry in these Islands a
century ago. Waikouaiti was a well-known whaling-station when
John Jones started his settlement there over seventy years ago.
Otakou (or Otago) was another; and it is not so long ago that
the old trying-down plant was still lying about Harrington Point.
Stewart Island and Foveaux Strait, Tautuku Bay, and other
sheltered spots on the coast were all originally settled by whalers.
But these days are gone, and the whales themselves are comparatively
rare. Whaling, however, is still carried on by motor-launch
from Tory Channel and other places.</p>

<p>Besides the species I have mentioned, another, allied to the
Sperm Whale, is occasionally met with. This is the Pigmy Whale
(<i>Kogia breviceps</i>), which differs in various anatomical respects from
its larger relative, but most markedly in its size, for it seldom
exceeds 15 ft. in length.</p>

<p>Several species belonging to the family of beaked whales have
been described from New Zealand waters by the late Sir James
Hector and other naturalists. They are by no means common
animals, but one reason of their rarity may be the fact of their
being chiefly found right down in the Antarctic Ocean, where they
are scarcely disturbed, as they have little commercial value.</p>

<p>Of the Porpoise Whale (<i>Berardius arnouxi</i>) only four or five
specimens have been met with, yet it is the only well-known species
of the genus. “It is 30 ft. to 32 ft. in length, and is of a velvety
black colour, with a greyish belly. Instead of lowing like a cow,
this whale has been described as ‘bellowing like a bull’!”</p>

<p>Of the genus <i>Mesoplodon</i>, which are known as Scamperdown
Whales, some five species are said to occur in New Zealand. They
are moderate-sized whales, 15 ft. to 17 ft. in length, which have a
world-wide distribution.</p>

<p>Another whale, known as the Goose-beak Whale (<i>Ziphius
cavirostris</i>) is probably the only species of the genus, and its distribution
is also world-wide. Beddard says of it, “Our knowledge
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>of <i>Ziphius</i> dates from the year 1804, when a skull, ‘completely
petrified in appearance,’ was picked up upon the Mediterranean
coast of France, and described by the great Cuvier. It was forty
years before another specimen was found. In the New Zealand
specimen described by von Haast the body was scored by numerous
lacerations. These wounds may have been due to fights among the
whales themselves; the forwardly-situated teeth would be capable
of inflicting such wounds. But it has also been stated that the
armed suckers of gigantic cuttlefish are responsible for these
scratches.”</p>

<p>Every one who has travelled up and down the coast, and most
who have sat by rocks overlooking the open ocean, are familiar
with the schools of porpoises which are so common in these southern
seas. It is interesting to watch them from the deck of a steamer,
and to see how they dash along near the surface of the water with
their peculiar gliding movement, curving their bodies as they
plunge in and out of the water. They keep a wonderful regularity
in their distance from one another, moving as if by mechanical
means with a remarkable rhythmic movement. Bullen gives a
short account of porpoise-hunting in the “Cruise of the Cachalot.”
He states that these animals have “no skin&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, hide&mdash;the blubber
or coating of lard which encases them being covered by a black
substance as thin as tissue paper. The porpoise-hide of the boot-maker,”
he adds, “is really leather made from the skin of the
<i>Beluga</i>, or ‘White Whale,’ which is found only in the far north.”
I cannot say whether this is accurate or not, for though I have
frequently seen porpoises at close quarters I have never seen them
cut up. Our species&mdash;<i>Cephalorhynchus hectori</i>&mdash;is usually from
5 ft. to 7 ft. long; it is quite distinct from the common European
species, which, indeed, belongs to a totally different genus.</p>

<p>The dolphin&mdash;<i>Delphinus delphis</i>&mdash;is perhaps the most familiar
of all cetaceans. It is a world-wide species, which is particularly
common in the Mediterranean. There it has been observed from
very early days, and a great number of mythical stories have
gathered round it; hence the stories of Arion and others. “The
leaping of the dolphin out of the water is exemplified in many
Mediterranean coins and coats-of-arms; the heraldic dolphin is
represented with an arched back as in leaping.” Many of the
animals usually claimed as porpoises are really dolphins.</p>

<p>One of the most famous animals of this group, one with a
world-wide reputation, is “Pelorus Jack,” the pilot-dolphin of the
French Pass, known for many years to every traveller between Wellington
and Nelson. This famous “whale” has been photographed
scores of times, and his general form and large dorsal fin are well
known. I am indebted to Messrs. Sharland and Co. (Limited) for
permission to reproduce the photograph shown in Fig. 8. For
something like twenty years he met every steamer that came
through the French Pass, whether by day or night. His “station,”
if one may use the word, was somewhere off the mouth of
Pelorus Sound, and as soon as a passing vessel got within a
mile or two of this region “Jack” would be seen racing along
until he was alongside, when he would escort the boat for some
distance before racing off again. Among various yarns told about
him was one that he used to rub himself on the vessels, presumably
either for a scratch on the back or to divest himself of some of the
fish-lice which frequently infest whales. I have seen him on several
occasions, and never to greater advantage than when he accompanied
the little trawling-steamer, the “Doto,” as we were going
into the French Pass. He kept alongside and played round the
bows for over five minutes, and then sheered off to visit a larger
vessel which was coming in from Cook Strait. In Hutton and
Drummond’s “Animals of New Zealand” he was stated to be a
<i>Beluga</i>, or White Whale, and was identified as <i>Delphinapterus
leucas</i>; but this is purely a northern species. Waite considers it
is a Risso’s Dolphin (<i>Grampus griseus</i>), and says “the general
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
colour of the animal is grey, curiously marked with scratch-like
lines, which are probably caused by the cuttlefishes which form the
staple food of the grampus.” In a pamphlet published in 1911
by James Cowan on “Pelorus Jack” it is stated that “he is a
dolphin of a bluish-white colour, tinged with purple and yellow,
and with irregular brown-edged scratch-like lines covering the
upper surface of his body. His flippers are dark in hue, mottled
with grey. He is about 14 ft. in length&mdash;as nearly as can be
judged, for he doesn’t stay still very long&mdash;and he is blunt of
nose, humped of forehead, with a high falcate (or scythe-shaped)
dorsal fin and a narrow fluked tail.” By an Order in Council of
the 29th September, 1904, it is notified that for five years from
that date it would not be lawful for any person “to take the fish
or mammal of the species commonly known as Risso’s Dolphin
(<i>Grampus griseus</i>) in the waters of Cook Strait, or of the bays,
sounds, and estuaries adjacent thereto.” Any person committing
a breach of this regulation was liable to a fine of not less than £5
nor more than £100. This regulation was renewed from time to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
time, an Order in Council of the 24th April, 1911, extending it
for a further period of five years. The regulation was aimed
solely at the protection of “Pelorus Jack,” the only individual
marine animal, I believe, which has thus secured Government
protection.</p>

</div>

<p>
<br />
</p>

<p>The Maoris believe that Kaikai-a-waro, as they call “Pelorus
Jack,” has been known to their race for some three centuries, and
a considerable body of legend has grown up about him. One
European skipper, Captain Turner, of Nelson, met with a big
white “fish” in Pelorus Sound nearly fifty years ago, and he
thinks this is the same as the whale which afterwards took up its
station towards the French Pass.</p>

<p>It was stated in 1911 that the carcase of “Pelorus Jack,”
bitten by sharks, had been washed up on D’Urville Island. It
was found, however, that the animal discovered there was a
bottle-nosed whale. Meanwhile it is a fact that the “pilot-whale”
has not been seen for some years, and whether he has “passed
out” or merely shifted his quarters no one knows.</p>

<p>The list of New Zealand whales is not yet exhausted. Mention
has just been made of the Bottle-nose (<i>Prodelphinus obscurus</i>),
which is not unfrequently met with. A more interesting animal
is the Killer Whale (<i>Orca gladiator</i>), often spoken of as the
“grampus,” a word which itself is a contraction of the French
<i>grand poisson</i>, or big fish. The killer is marked with contrasting
bands of white or yellow upon a black body-colour. It is a fairly
large species, growing to a length of 30 ft. It is a powerful and
rapacious whale, and it is stated that as many as thirteen porpoises
and fourteen seals were taken from the stomach of one of them.
This is a large order, and perhaps the culprit died of a surfeit;
if not, it certainly deserved to.</p>

<p>The killers sometimes combine to attack larger whales, and in
Bullen’s interesting book he repeats an account of a combat which
he witnessed between a bull cachalot and such a combination of
enemies. Two hungry killers and a 16 ft. swordfish joined forces
to attack the big whale. The swordfish launched himself at the
monster, but the latter turned in time to receive the shock on the
head, and the blow glanced off it, the fish rolling helplessly over
the top of the whale. With a sudden rapid movement the latter
turned, grasped the aggressor with his immense jaws and crunched
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>him into two portions, which he promptly swallowed. Then, with a
terrific lash of his tail, he came down on one of the killers, and
“crushed it like a shrimp under one’s heel.” Here is Bullen’s
conclusion: “The survivor fled&mdash;never faster&mdash;for an avalanche
of living furious flesh was behind him, and coming with enormous
leaps half out of the sea every time. Thus they disappeared, but
I have no doubt as to the issue. Of one thing I am certain: that
if any of the trio survived they never afterwards attempted to rush
a cachalot.” Bullen is rather mixed in this narrative. According
to a Dr. Frangius, “When an Orca pursues a whale the latter makes
a terrible bellowing, like a bull when bitten by a dog.” He may
be referring to a Right Whale, for certainly his remark does not
apply to the Sperm Whale, which is a dangerous foe to all its
enemies.</p>

<p>The Cowfish (<i>Tursiops tursio</i>) is a beaked whale, some 12 ft.
long, which has been taken in New Zealand waters. The colour of
the back varies from black to lead-colour, while the under-parts
are white. It is a species of world-wide range.</p>

<p>So is the last of the whales which I shall mention, the Blackfish
(<i>Globicephalus melas</i>), known in the Hebrides and the west of
Scotland as the “ca’ing whale.” This is one of the largest of the
dolphins, reaching some 20 ft. in length. It is a gregarious species,
moving about in great schools or shoals. Its sheep-like habits
enable it to be easily driven on shore in herds, when the animals
are easily harpooned. Schools of Blackfish not unfrequently visit
the inlets and shores of the North of Auckland. Bullen gives an
account of an attack on an immense school of Blackfish which the
“Cachalot” encountered when near Christmas Island in the mid-Pacific.</p>

<p>Any one interested in the natural history of the sea will find
the study of its cetaceans is still in a very incomplete state. Few
people know anything about them scientifically, because their occurrence
and the opportunity of studying them at first hand are so
erratic and rare. When a whale comes ashore it is usually in some
inaccessible place, and if the fact is communicated to a museum
the finder usually places a considerable price on his discovery, which
makes the investigation too expensive to be undertaken. When
our fisheries are properly organized it will be possible to study the
cetacean fauna much more closely and accurately than is at present
the case.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<h3>CARNIVORA&mdash;CATS AND DOGS.</h3>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Five</span> species of carnivorous animals (exclusive of menagerie specimens)
have been introduced into New Zealand. Cats and dogs
are domestic animals of which numerous individuals have gone wild
from time to time; while ferrets, stoats, and weasels have been
liberated and are now common.</p>

<p>One of the most characteristic features of the land carnivora is
“the looseness of their skin, which, instead of being stretched on
the body as tightly as a drum-parchment, as it is in grass-eaters&mdash;for
instance, the ox or hippopotamus&mdash;is quite ‘baggy,’ having
between it and the flesh of the beast a layer of the loosest possible
fibres. It is for this reason that the skin of any but a very fat
dog can be pinched up so readily, while of an herbivore it may be
said, in the words of eulogy uttered by Mr. Squeers of his son
Wackford, ‘Here’s firmness, here’s solidness! Why, you can
hardly get up enough of him between your fingers and thumb to
pinch him anywheres.’” As Parker says, “The use of this loose
skin will be very evident to any one who will take the trouble to
watch the great cats playing together at the Zoological Gardens.
They are continually scratching one another, but the loose skin is
dragged round by the claws, which in consequence can get no
hold and do no harm; with a tight skin, on the other hand, the
slightest scratch of such a claw as a tiger’s would cause a serious
wound. The looseness of the skin is very evident in the puma
and jaguar, in which it hangs in a fold along the middle of the
belly, like a great dewlap.”</p>

<p>The skull is very strongly developed, and has great bony ridges
for the attachment of the jaw-muscles. In herbivorous animals
the brain-case is small and the face much prolonged; but in
carnivores&mdash;especially cats&mdash;the face is very short relatively to the
cranial portion of the skull. The higher carnivora cannot chew
or grind their food; they only tear it and mince it. Cats and dogs
walk on the toes, the under-surfaces of which are covered with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>soft leathery pads, so as to ensure a soft, silent footstep. What
looks like the knee is really the wrist, and what looks like a backward-turned
knee in the hind leg is the heel, the true elbow and
knee being almost hidden by the skin. In all carnivores the canine
teeth are relatively very large. All of them have the senses of
sight and hearing very well developed. The young are always born
in a comparatively helpless condition, and are generally blind for
some time after their birth.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Cat.</span></h3>

<p>There is no record as to the first introduction of cats into New
Zealand; but no doubt they were brought here by the very first
settlers&mdash;perhaps earlier even, by the crews of vessels which called
at Kororareka and other parts of this county in the very early
whaling days. They do not seem to have strayed far from the
haunts of men until rabbits began to multiply. Then, when the
sheep-farmers found that the capacity of the country for carrying
sheep was being seriously reduced by the vast increase of rabbits,
they resorted to all sorts of devices to cope with the pest. One
method was to purchase cats in the towns, take them out to the
back country, feed them for a time till they became somewhat
habituated to the locality, and then turn them loose. No doubt
some died, but most of them became more or less wild, and learned
to subsist on the smaller animals of the neighbourhood. Probably
native ground-birds suffered most from their presence. They certainly
destroyed many young rabbits, but it is also true that they
were frequently found living and rearing their young in burrows
alongside families of rabbits. They cleared off the rats, which
were formerly so common, and they also largely exterminated
lizards. My son, Dr. Allan Thomson, tells me that in the Awatere
Valley, in Marlborough, rabbit-hunting cats are greatly esteemed
by the settlers, and are believed to be much more efficient than stoats
and weasels. They are only partly wild, as frequently the domestic
cats feed their young on rabbits and interbreed freely with wild
cats living near the homesteads. He observed a cat at Awapiri
teaching two kittens to kill. She would leave the house, and in
about ten minutes’ time would return with a baby rabbit, evidently
obtained from a stop. When the kittens were very young she
killed the rabbit and skinned it. A week or two later she would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>give them the dead rabbit with the skin just partially turned back,
and they quickly learned to complete the skinning. Still later
she gave them the live rabbit, with which at first they played, but
in a very short time they learned to approach the rabbit from
behind and grip it by the neck, lying practically on top of it
and pinching the gullet until the rabbit was strangled. Cats, in
his opinion, become rabbit-killers only when they are thus taught
by their mothers, but once they acquire the habit they feed on little
else.</p>

<p>Dieffenbach, writing of the Piako district in Auckland Province
in 1839, says, “The cats, which, on becoming wild, have
assumed the streaky grey colour of the original animal while in a
state of nature, form a great obstacle to the propagation of any
new kinds of birds, and also tend to the destruction of many
indigenous species.” This statement about the colour of wild cats
has been made much of. It is true to only a very limited extent,
and I have always felt that such statements&mdash;coming from a
traveller who had only limited means of observing the facts, and
apparently founded his conclusions on a few isolated observations
of the settlers&mdash;are not always safe to generalize from. In the
present instance they led Darwin (in “The Variation of Plants
and Animals under Domestication”) to quote him, and to use the
statement as a proof of the strong tendency to reversion shown by
the cat when it escaped from domestication. At the time Dieffenbach
wrote settlement was quite in its infancy, and cats had not
long been introduced. It is probable, therefore, that his statement,
whether the result of his own or other people’s observations, referred
to cats which were themselves progeny of grey animals. It certainly
is the case that in Central Otago, where cats were freely
liberated to cope with the rabbit pest, animals of many and varied
colours are now found wild. Mr. Robert Scott, formerly M.P. for
Central Otago, who had exceptional opportunities for observing the
facts, has recently given me most interesting information regarding
this question. He says, “The wild cat was, no doubt, the descendant
of the shepherd’s and miner’s tame cat. The predominating colour
was grey-striped (or tiger-striped, as some people called them),
occasionally yellow, and rarely black or black-and-white. The
time I write of was the ‘seventies’&mdash;say, from 1870 on to the
time when poisoning the rabbits with phosphorized grain came in.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>The cats, though not numerous, were fairly common, especially in
districts where cover, such as fern and scrub, was plentiful. They
grew to an immense size, and were game to the last if attacked;
in fact, no dog would tackle one single-handed. They were always
in the pink of condition, which may be accounted for by the
abundance of feed available in the shape of wekas, ducks, and rats,
with perhaps a dead sheep or bullock occasionally. When the
rabbit-poisoning came in that class or variety of cat disappeared
along with the wild pig and weka. The reason for the extermination
of the cat is because it prefers the entrails to the flesh. Since
that time, up to the present, cats have been turned out in considerable
numbers, but the rabbit-trapping has effectually prevented their
increase, and the survivors still retain their original colours&mdash;that
is, black, black-and-white, grey, grey-and-white, &amp;c.; but they are
much smaller than the wild cat of forty years ago. My opinion
is that had the original cat survived till to-day the colour would
have invariably been grey, or, rather, grey-striped.”</p>

<p>Mr. H. C. Weir, of Ida Valley Station, Otago, states that on
high country, where rabbit-traps are seldom if ever used, they grow
to a very considerable size, and are most commonly of a grey
colour; but yellow, grey-and-white, and black are also to be met
with. He adds, “I cannot say I ever saw any approaching the
tiger-like stripe of the Home-country wild cat, and I have seen a
good few of them in the wilds of Sutherlandshire, Scotland.”</p>

<p>Some people consider that wild cats are responsible for much
of the failure which has followed the constantly renewed attempts
to naturalize game birds. At the annual meeting of the Wellington
Acclimatization Society in 1898 a member said, “Cats are more
destructive to game than all the hawks, weasels, and stoats in the
colony. Most of the bush coverts are full of these cats, a fact
which I myself proved near Feilding, where, with the assistance
of traps baited with smoked fish, I caught many.” I think they
may have contributed to some extent to this failure, but only in
a few parts of the country, and then chiefly in the neighbourhood
of settlements. Personally, I do not think that wild cats have had
much to do with the extermination of introduced game. The whole
question is a difficult one to get any definite knowledge upon,
opinions differ so much. Thus Mr. Charles J. Peters, of Mount
Somers, considers that wild cats are far more effective in keeping
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>down rabbits than are stoats or weasels, and estimates that cats will
kill more rabbits in a month than one of the others will in six
months.</p>

<p>Mr. B. C. Aston, in a paper on the Kaikoura Mountains, speaks
of the half-wild cats which are found about deserted fencers’ and
musterers’ camps as retaining “all their love for man’s comradeship
if encouraged, but they invariably refuse to eat anything
that they have not killed themselves. They probably exist on
rabbits, birds, and mice. As a result of their hunting habits
their chest and forelegs are largely developed, and they have a
look different from the ordinary cat, being leaner, and quicker in
action.”</p>

<p>Wild cats, so my son Dr. Allan Thomson tells me, are the bane
of the island sanctuaries of New Zealand, being present on Kapiti
Island, Little Barrier Island, and Stephen Island, in which last
they kill and eat the tuatara. They have been reduced to small
numbers by shooting, but their complete extermination has not yet
been accomplished.</p>

<p>When the Russian Commander Bellingshausen visited the
Macquaries in 1820 he found numbers of wild cats hid among
the foliage. There were at the time, however, two parties of
traders (seal-hunters?) on the island, one of thirteen and the
other of twenty-seven men, and these probably accounted for
the cats.</p>

<p>Captain Musgrave, who was a castaway from the schooner
“Grafton,” when she was wrecked on the Auckland Islands in
1864, found a cat in a trap more than a year after the date of
the wreck. “She soon cleared the hut of mice, which were dreadfully
common.”</p>

<p>In 1868 Mr. H. H. Travers, in his account of a visit to the
Chatham Islands, states that wild cats were very abundant, and that
they destroyed a great number of the indigenous birds.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Wild Dogs.</span></h3>

<p>It may seem strange to speak of dogs as wild animals in New
Zealand, and it is questionable whether there are any wild dogs
at the present time, but in the early days of settlement they were
fairly abundant, and were truly feral. Dogs are the most
thoroughly domesticated of animals, and in none has the moral
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>and intellectual faculties been more highly developed. But just as
some men degrade these faculties to the basest uses and become a
menace to the rest of their race, so some dogs&mdash;only a few, it must
be admitted&mdash;go wild and become a menace to their human companions
and masters.</p>

<p>It is of interest to remember that when Captain Cook came to
New Zealand the Natives had dogs, which they had brought with
them from their original homes in Polynesia. Most of the histories
of the migrations of the Maori refer to the fact of their bringing
dogs with them, so that they had probably been in the country
for some centuries before the date of Cook’s visit in 1769. Crozet,
who visited these Islands in 1772, saw these dogs, and described
them as follows: “The dogs are a sort of domesticated fox, quite
black or white, very low on the legs, straight ears, thick tail, long
body, full jaws, but more pointed than that of the fox, and uttering
the same cry. They do not bark like our dogs. These animals
are only fed on fish, and it appears that the savages only raise them
for food. Some were taken on board our vessels, but it was
impossible to domesticate them like our dogs: they were always
treacherous, and bit us frequently. They would have been
dangerous to keep where poultry was raised or had to be protected:
they would destroy them just like true foxes.”</p>

<p>Forster, in his account of Cook’s second voyage, writing of the
Queen Charlotte Sound Natives in 1773, says, “A good many dogs
were observed in their canoes, which they seemed very fond of, and
kept tied with a string round their middle. They were of a rough,
long-haired sort, with pricked ears, and much resembled the
common shepherd’s cur or Count Buffon’s <i>chien de berger</i>. They
were of different colours, some quite black and others perfectly
white. The food which these dogs receive is fish, or the same as
their masters live on, who afterwards eat their flesh and employ
the fur in various ornaments and dresses.” Later on in the
same journal he says, “The officers had ordered their black dog
to be killed, and sent to the captain one-half of it. This day
(June 9), therefore, we dined for the first time on a leg of it roasted,
which tasted so exactly like mutton that it was absolutely undistinguishable....
In New Zealand and in the tropical isles
of the South Sea the dogs are the most stupid, dull animals
imaginable, and do not seem to have the least advantage in point
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>of sagacity over our sheep. In the former country they are fed
upon fish; in the latter, on vegetables.”</p>

<p>Bellingshausen, who visited New Zealand in 1820, says, “We
saw no quadrupeds except dogs of a small species. Captain Lazarew
bought a couple. They are rather small, have a woolly tail, erect
ears, a large mouth, and short legs.”</p>

<p>Dieffenbach, writing nearly seventy years after Cook’s visit,
remarks that “the native dog was formerly considered a dainty,
and great numbers of them were eaten; but the breed having
undergone an almost complete mixture with the European, their
use as an article of food has been discontinued, as the European
dogs are said by the Natives to be perfectly unpalatable. The New
Zealand dog is different from the Australian dingo; the latter
resembles in size and shape the wolf, while the former rather
resembles the jackal.”</p>

<p>The Rev. Richard Taylor, author of “Te Ika a Maui,” who is
not always a reliable authority where natural history is concerned,
says, “The New Zealand dog was small and long-haired, of a dirty
white or yellow colour, with a bushy tail. This the Natives say
they brought with them when they first came to these Islands.”
Then he adds, “It is not improbable, however, that they found
another kind already in the country, brought by the older Melanesian
race, with long white hair and black tail: it is said to have
been very quiet and docile.”</p>

<p>The Maori dog has totally disappeared. Mr. S. Percy Smith,
of New Plymouth, tells me that the last one he heard of was about
1896. But I have mentioned it here because it was in part the
progenitor of the wild dogs which afterwards became such a
dangerous nuisance to sheep-breeders.</p>

<p>When settlement began European dogs must have crossed freely
with the native animal, and many, both of the introduced and
crossed dogs, became truly wild, especially as there were sheep and
goats to worry, and pigs to chase and kill.</p>

<p>Dr. Lyall, who was surgeon on H.M.S. “Acheron” during the
survey of the coast of New Zealand in 1844, says of the kakapo,
or owl-parrot, that “at a very recent period it was common all
over the west coast of the Middle Island; but <i>there is now a race
of wild dogs</i> said to have overrun all the northern part of this
shore, and to have almost exterminated the kakapo wherever they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>have reached.” Brunner, who visited the West Coast a few years
later, makes a similar statement in his Journal. The early settlers
could not distinguish between Maori dogs and these wild, half-bred
curs. Thus R. Gillies, writing in after-years of the early days
of the Otago settlement, which was formed in 1848, says, “For some
years after the settlers arrived here the wild dog was the terror
of the flockmaster, and the object of his inveterate hostility.”
W. D. Murison, formerly editor of the <i>Otago Daily Times</i>, writing
at the same period (1877), tells how in 1858 he and his brother
took up country in the Maniototo Plains, which they reached by
the valley of the Shag River. The wild dogs were very troublesome.
The first was caught by a kangaroo-dog, apparently imported
from Australia for the purpose of hunting them. “This
particular wild dog was yellow in colour, and so was the second
killed; but the bulk of those ultimately destroyed by us were
black-and-white, showing a marked mixture of the collie. The
yellow dogs looked like a distinct breed. They were low-set, with
short pricked ears, broad forehead, sharp snout, and bushy tail.
Indeed, those acquainted with the dingo professed to see little
difference between that animal and the New Zealand yellow wild
dog. It may be remarked, however, that most of the other dogs
we killed, although variously coloured, possessed nearly all the
other characteristics of the yellow dog. The wild dogs were
generally to be met with in twos and threes; they fed chiefly on
quail, ground-larks, young ducks, and occasionally on pigs. On
one occasion, when riding through the Idaburn Valley, we came
across four wild dogs baiting a sow and her litter of young ones
in a dry, tussocky lagoon. To our annoyance our own dogs joined
in the attack upon the sow, and the wild dogs got away without
our getting one of them.... In all we destroyed fifty-two
dogs between September, 1858, and December, 1860.”</p>

<p>Taylor White, writing in 1889, says, “I consider these dogs
entirely distinct from the European dog. For the wild dogs met
with on the Waimakariri River, in the alpine ranges of Canterbury,
during the year 1856, were in colour and markings identical with
those found in the alpine region of Lake Wakatipu in 1860, a distance
of several hundred miles apart. There seems little room to
doubt that they were an original Maori dog. The fact of their
wanting the two tan spots over the eyes mostly seen in European
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>dogs of approximate colour is a very strong evidence also in favour
of this opinion.”</p>

<p>At one time wild dogs were so common in Marlborough and did
so much damage on the sheep-runs that packs of hunting-dogs
were bred for the special purpose of running them down. As
settlement proceeded and the country became opened up wild dogs
were gradually exterminated. The only ones which are now met
with are curs which have taken to rabbits or to sheep-killing, and
have managed to escape from their owners.</p>

<p>Bellingshausen reported wild dogs on the Macquaries in 1820,
but it is improbable that they long survived the sealers, who probably
generally brought them to the islands. As soon as the killing
of seals and sea-lions stopped the dogs in all probability died out.
Captain Musgrave, who was wrecked on Auckland Island in
1864, discovered wild dogs, like sheep-dogs, on the island. Their
case, however, was probably similar to those on the Macquaries,
for I am not aware that any subsequent visitor to the island has
seen them.</p>

<p>In a reprint from the Auckland <i>Herald</i> of the 18th November,
1866, we read, “It is not generally known that about Otamatea
and the Wairoa the bush is infested with packs of wild dogs, as
ferocious, but more daring, than wolves. These dogs hunt in packs
of from three to six or eight. They are strong, gaunt, large
animals, and dangerous when met by a man alone. Not long since
a Maori, when travelling from one settlement to another through
the forest, was attacked by three of these animals at dusk, and
only saved himself by climbing into a tree, where he was kept
prisoner until late the next day. The extensive district over which
these packs roam was once well stocked with wild pigs, but most
of these have fallen victims to the dogs, and since this supply of
food has failed the dogs have ventured after dark to the neighbourhood
of Native settlements and the homesteads of European settlers
in quest of prey.”</p>

<h3>CARNIVORA&mdash;FERRETS, STOATS, AND WEASELS.</h3>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> Mustelidae, or weasel family, is the most heterogeneous
assemblage of all the carnivorous group. Though differing much
among themselves, they possess certain important characters in
common. One of the most familiar is the presence of anal glands,
situated beneath the root of the tail, which contain a more or less
noxious and evil-smelling fluid. The three members of the family
which have been introduced into New Zealand belong to the genus
<i>Putorius</i>, which receives its name from the Latin word <i>putor</i>, a
stench. The most notorious example is the American species, the
skunk, whose perfume is so strong that David Harum records how
a man who killed one went into the woods for a week and “hated
hisself.”</p>

<p>Of all intentional introductions to this country that of the
animals of this family is the most unfortunate and undesirable.
The history of the business is, to my mind, a depressing one, for
it shows what people are prepared to do to save their own pockets,
whatever the effect may be upon others. These animals have not
done what was expected of them&mdash;namely, suppressed the rabbits,
or even kept them in check, but they have exercised a most baneful
influence on the bird-life of the country. The characteristics of
the three species are somewhat similar. They have been called
vermiform animals, for they have a singularly worm-like appearance.
The body is long, narrow, and cylindrical in shape, while
the legs are relatively extremely short. The neck is also very long,
and bears a small, flattened head; the eyes are small, savage-looking,
and glittering.</p>

<p>The ferret is closely allied to the polecat, but is a domesticated
variety, and is zoologically interesting, because it is a true-breeding
albino, having white fur and pink eyes. It originated in Africa,
and retains this characteristic of its warm origin: that it is unable
to endure great cold; hence if it goes wild in New Zealand it usually
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>survives only in warm and sheltered localities. It is from 12 in.
to 15 in. long, and is a stouter animal than either of the others.
Though a semi-domesticated animal, it never shows the slightest
affection for its master, and has usually to be kept in confinement.
My son, Dr. Allan Thomson, tells me that about Kekerangu, in
Marlborough, wild ferrets are at present very numerous.</p>

<p>I have no record of the introduction of the true polecat
(<i>Putorius foetidus</i>) into these Islands; but some five or six
years ago Mr. Anderton, curator of the Portobello Marine Fish-hatchery,
shot two animals which were too large for stoats, being
about 18 in. long. They were not ferrets, in that they were brown-coloured.
Unfortunately he did not keep the bodies, their smell,
for one thing, being so offensive; so their specific character was not
determined.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 9.&mdash;The Ferret.</span></p>
</div>

<p>
<br />
</p>

<p>The stoat is about 1 ft. long and is somewhat distinctively
coloured. “In summer the upper parts vary from yellowish-brown
to mahogany-brown, while the underside is white tinged with
sulphur-yellow, except on the throat, which is pure white. The tail
is tipped with black. The brown upper and white under surfaces
are separated by a perfectly distinct line of demarcation, which
extends from the snout to the root of the tail, dipping down at
the limbs, so as to include the outer surfaces of the latter in the
dark area. In winter, on the other hand, the skin is&mdash;with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>exception of the tip of the tail, which always remains black&mdash;pure
white, tinged here and there with sulphur-yellow. Intermediate
states between full winter dress and full summer dress are often
found.” In winter, when the fur is white, the animal is known
as the ermine, and white stoats are well known in winter in the
South Island. The favourite food of the stoat consists of rats
and mice, but it is fond of birds, and thus is a danger in a
poultry-yard. It occasionally attacks lambs. These creatures
seem often to kill for the mere sake of killing. In my boyhood
days I at one time kept a large number of rabbits in an enclosure.
One night a stoat got in and killed the whole lot&mdash;over a dozen&mdash;and
left each with a hole in the back of its head. These animals
are fairly abundant over New Zealand at the present time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span></p>
<p>One is frequently asked what is the difference between a stoat
and a weasel. According to one authority, the one “is stoatally
different from the other, and weasely distinguished.” But this
does not help us much. The weasel “in length, from snout to
root of tail, does not exceed 8 in. The tail is about 2 in. long.
The fur is light reddish-brown above, and white below.” The size
and black-tipped tail best distinguish the stoat. The weasel is a
good climber, and makes use of its skill in this accomplishment to
prey upon birds, their eggs and young. Rats and mice are its
favourite food.</p>

<p>The history of the introduction of these vermin into this country
is characteristic of the acclimatization methods of the past. Ferrets
have been introduced from early times by dealers in birds and
animals. The first authentic record is that of the Canterbury Acclimatization
Society, which received five in 1867. They were apparently
not liberated, nor were subsequent introductions for some
time. When rabbits began to increase to an alarming extent various
suggestions were made as to the importation of what was called “the
natural enemy.” The fox is the real natural enemy of the rabbit,
but this was too risky a proposal to be made. The Victorian Government
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>had already allowed some idiots to introduce foxes into that
country in order to allow them the pleasures of fox-hunting, and
the result has not been encouraging. One well-known public man
in New Zealand proposed to introduce Arctic foxes “because their
fur would be so valuable.” When it was pointed out to him that
they would probably prefer lamb to rabbit, he replied that, as they
did not know anything about lambs in their native haunts, it was
improbable that they would take to eating them in New Zealand.
Fortunately his proposal was not given effect to. Meanwhile sheepowners
brought pressure to bear on the Government, and as a
result steps were taken to obtain ferrets. Numbers of these were
introduced in 1882, and in the following year Mr. Bailey, Chief
Rabbit Inspector, recommended the introduction of stoats and
weasels. To show the scale on which these recommendations were
carried out, I summarize from Mr. Bailey’s reports as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>(<i>a.</i>) In July, 1883, it is stated that since March, 1882 (fifteen
months), the Agent-General had made thirty-two shipments of
ferrets from London, numbering altogether 1,217 animals. Of
these, only 178 were landed, at a cost of £953. Of 241 purchased
in Melbourne, 198 were landed, at a cost of £224. Thus the total
number landed was 376, and the cost £1,177, or £3 2s. 7d. per
head. The natural increase was 122, but 157 died of distemper.
At this period it would seem as if the Government kept a perfect
menagerie of these animals. In the same year a substantial bonus
was offered to any one who would introduce a certain number of
stoats or weasels in a healthy condition.</p>

<p>(<i>b.</i>) In 1884 he reports “nearly 4,000 ferrets were turned out;
3,041 in Marlborough alone, and about 400 on Crown land in
Otago.” The rest appear to have been sold to private individuals.
It is evident that there was no study of the suitability of a semi-domesticated
subtropical animal becoming acclimatized in this
country, and, as a matter of fact, the ferret has not gone wild in
the South Island to any great extent. Mr. Bailey also stated in
this report that “an agent has been sent Home to procure stoats
and weasels.” Mr. Rich, of Palmerston, imported some of these
latter in a sailing-vessel, but how many I cannot learn.</p>

<p>(<i>c.</i>) In 1885 two lots of stoats and weasels were received from
London&mdash;viz., 183 weasels (out of 202 shipped) and 55 stoats (out
of 60). Of these, 67 weasels were released at Lake Wanaka on a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>peninsula of 8,000 acres, on which they reduced the rabbits, but by
no means exterminated them; 28 weasels were liberated at Lake
Wakatipu; 15 weasels near the Waiau River, in Southland; and
8 stoats at Ashburton. The rest were sold at Wellington, Christchurch,
and Dunedin.</p>

<p>(<i>d.</i>) In 1886 the Government introduced two lots. Of these,
82 stoats and 126 weasels were distributed in about equal lots to
the Wilkin River, the Makarora, at the head of Lake Ohau, and
on the Waitaki; and 32 stoats and 116 weasels were distributed
between Marlborough and West Wairarapa. A private shipment
of 55 stoats and 167 weasels was also received for Riddiford’s
station in West Wairarapa. The localities selected for these animals
were those in which rabbits were most abundant. Mr. Bailey also
reported that “ferrets were turned out by thousands,” but the
success was only partial.</p>

<p>In the same year a meeting was held at Masterton to consider
the administration of the Rabbit Act, and the best means of dealing
with the pest. One of the resolutions carried was, “That the
introduction of ferrets, stoats, and weasels in large numbers is
in the opinion of this meeting the only means by which the rabbit
pest can be successfully put an end to, and that every owner of
land infested with rabbits should either turn out ferrets in proportion
to his acreage or contribute to a fund for the breeding
and purchase of ferrets, stoats, and weasels to be turned out in the
district. That the landowners present form themselves into an
association for the purpose of providing the natural enemies.”
An association was accordingly formed with this object in view,
large sums of money were subscribed, and hundreds of stoats and
weasels were introduced into the district. Several of the acclimatization
societies took strong exception to the action of the
Government and of the sheepowners directly concerned; but as the
societies were themselves directly responsible for the rabbits to a
large extent their protests were ineffectual.</p>

<p>These animals have not exterminated the rabbits; they do not
even keep them in check in most parts. They have, however, helped
in the practical extermination over wide areas of many species of
indigenous birds, for they have penetrated into quite unsettled
and unbroken parts of the country, where apparently they feed on
the avifauna.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span></p>
<p>Every one who has had any experience of these vermin has his
own view as to their usefulness or otherwise, but it is seldom that
careful observers put their experiences down on paper. I have
collected some evidence on this subject, and give here a few of the
observations which have been recorded.</p>

<p>Mr. George Mueller, Chief Surveyor of Westland, in his report
on the “Reconnaissance Survey of the Headwaters of the Okuru,
Actor, and Burke Rivers” (Reports N.Z. Survey Department for
1889–90, p. 50), says, “Several weasels and ferrets were caught
and killed at the Okuru and Waiatoto Settlements, within about a
mile from the sea-coast.... No rabbits were met with until
near the Actor, nineteen miles from the coast, and they were only
seen in numbers at the very headwaters of the Okuru....
Meanwhile the kakapos, kiwis, and blue ducks have nearly disappeared
from the district.”</p>

<p>Mr. Richard Henry, writing from Lake Te Anau in September,
1890, says, “I have known the ferrets to take young paradise
ducks out of a clutch often in 1888, and last year the same pair
of ducks reared only two young ones; but away from the lake I
have seen larger families. I found two black teal ducks killed by
a ferret, though it is seldom any of their work is seen, for they
always drag their prey under cover. The black teal are getting
scarce.” Mr. Henry adds, “I think very few ferrets at liberty
survive the winter for want of food.” My own opinion is that they
cannot endure the cold.</p>

<p>Mr. Richard Norman, Albert Town, writing in the <i>Otago Witness</i>
of the 2nd October, 1890, says, “I think that Mr. E. H. Wilmot’s
experience in the Hollyford Valley, as recorded in the <i>Witness</i> a
year or two ago, conclusively proves that the imported vermin kill
the native wingless birds. He encountered there a ferret-warren,
and the weka, kiwi, and kakapo were almost exterminated. In
the Makarora Valley these used to be plentiful, but since the advent
of the stoats and weasels they are very rare, and rabbiting tallies
have not depreciated.”</p>

<p>Mr. Charles J. Peters, of Mount Somers, writes about these
animals (1916): “Since the stoats and weasels became fairly
numerous the rabbits have increased 100 per cent. and more.
I have found weasels’ nests both in heaps of fencing-material and
also in rabbit-burrows. These nests have always been made of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>skylarks’ feathers. I have also found parts of young hares at
weasels’ camps, but never a sign of a rabbit.”</p>

<p>Mr. Yarborough, of Kohukohu (Hokianga), states that stoats
and weasels do not seem to be so numerous now (1916) as they were
some few years ago. At that time a great number of these intrepid
little animals appeared on the eastern side of Hokianga Estuary,
and were occasionally observed swimming across the river, which
is about a mile wide. For the last year or more they have neither
been seen nor heard of. The same observation has been made of
the occurrence of these animals on the peninsula on which the Portobello
Marine Fish-hatchery stands. Three or four years ago they
were very abundant, but recently there are few to be seen.</p>

<p>In Taranaki a correspondent informed me last year that either
stoats or weasels destroyed a litter of nine sucking-pigs in one
night. Another informant states that “at Lee Stream, in the
Taieri district, I saw a rabbit paralysed with fright and uttering
squeals of terror, and on looking for the cause observed a stoat
fully 10 ft. away walking deliberately towards its victim. The
rabbit was killed by one bite on the neck. A few weeks ago a lady
informed me that she had seen a somewhat similar occurrence at
Brighton, but in this case the rabbit struggled to the lady for protection,
and fell trembling at her feet, while the stoat disappeared.”</p>

<p>A few years ago stoats were fairly common in the suburbs of
Wellington, and made great depredations amongst poultry, entering
the fowlhouses at night. My son describes seeing a couple
playing in a vacant section at Hataitai, and taking not the slightest
notice of passers-by.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X"></a>CHAPTER X.</h2>

<h3>CARNIVORA&mdash;SEALS.</h3>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> wild life of New Zealand includes members of the marine
Carnivora and of the Cetacea; but these animals are known only
to the relatively few persons who “go down to the sea in ships,
that do business in great waters,” and to some residents of
the sea-coast. I say “some residents” because too many who
live by the seaside know nothing of the wonders of the ocean.</p>

<p>The marine Carnivora belong to the section Pinnipedia&mdash;literally
“fin-footed”&mdash;so termed because the limbs are modified
into flippers.</p>

<p>When New Zealand was discovered by Europeans seals were
extraordinarily abundant on the coasts, but they shared the fate
of similar unprotected animals in other parts of the world. Their
fur and oil were valuable and were easily obtained, and the
animals were slaughtered so mercilessly that they were nearly exterminated.
Only one species, the fur-seal (<i>Arctocephalus forsteri</i>),
occurred commonly on the shores of the three main islands of New
Zealand, though the sea-leopard (<i>Ogmorhinus leptonyx</i>) was an
occasional visitor. As these animals are now protected, a few
stray ones still come inshore, but they are somewhat rare visitors.</p>

<p>Before referring at length to the fur-seal I may with advantage
quote what Sir James Hector had to say about other species in a
report he prepared for the Minister of Marine in 1892. He states
that the hair-seal, or sea-lion (<i>Eumetopias hookeri</i>), used to take up
its station on the west coast of the South Island about December.
The animals are polygamous, and the males are enormously larger
than the females. The males arrive first. “Soon afterwards the
cow seals appear, and on landing give birth to the young, each
male securing a harem of ten to twenty cows, and protecting the
mothers and young pups. The rutting season is in January, after
which the males (or lions) leave the mothers to bring up the young
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>until May, when they all leave the coast for the winter. The mode
of life of the hair-seals has, however, been much altered since 1863,
when I made my first observations, and I believe that the New
Zealand hair-seals have now become much more solitary, and that
they will soon become extinct.”</p>

<p>When I was in the extreme south of Stewart Island in 1874
I found the tracks of these animals in the scrub close to the
water’s edge, though I did not meet with the sea-lions themselves.
I have not heard of one being seen for many a long day.</p>

<p>Speaking of the sea-leopard, Hector wrote as follows: “This
is common round the New Zealand coast, but is a solitary animal.
They frequently come on shore, and, notwithstanding their feeble
powers of locomotion, they scramble far back into the bush in flat
country, and occasionally ascend rivers for a long distance. For
instance, one of the seals ascended the Waikato River a few years
ago as far as Hamilton, and was claimed by the Maoris as being a
real <i>taniwha</i>.”</p>

<p>The fur-seal (<i>Arctocephalus forsteri</i>) is named after J. R.
Forster, the naturalist who accompanied Captain Cook on his
second voyage of circumnavigation. When in Dusky Bay the
seals were found in great numbers on the rocks in the sound,
Forster described them as seals with ears (the northern seals being
earless), free hands, feet webbed on the under-surface, naked
between the fingers, and hardly nailed. “Gregarious in habit,
they are timid, and fling themselves off the rocks into the sea on
the approach of man; but the most powerful resist when attacked,
bite the weapons used against them, and even venture to assail the
boats. They swim with such rapidity that a boat rowed by six
strong men can scarcely keep up with them. Tenacious of life to
a degree, a fractured skull did not despatch them.” These animals
are from 6 ft. to 7 ft. in length; the anterior flipper is about
30 in. long; and the posterior about 15 in. Full-grown males
weigh 260 lb. and over, and females from 200 lb. to 220 lb. The
hair is soft and black, with reddish-grey tips, and the under-fur
is a delicate reddish colour. In old specimens the hairs are tipped
with white.</p>

<p>Hector, writing in 1892, says, “I spent from June, 1863,
to January, 1864, in the western sounds of Otago, and have since
made occasional visits at other seasons, but chiefly during the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>summer months, from February to May. I have always observed
the seals closely, and have collected many specimens. The male
fur-seal used to arrive about the 5th November on inaccessible
rocky platforms outside the entrance to the fiords or sounds, and
the cows began to arrive about the 1st December. At the same
date all the young stock&mdash;males up to seven and females up to
three or four years old&mdash;went to still more exposed places by
themselves, and spent the moulting season until about the end of
March, when, having acquired the new fur coat, they proceeded
to sea. The last of these ‘hauling-grounds,’ as they are called,
I have known in New Zealand was at Cape Foulwind, but formerly
they were all round the coast. In the breeding-grounds, or
‘rookeries,’ the old males keep guard on the females and newly-born
pups until the close of the rutting season, about the 15th
February, and then desert them, being then in a feeble and
emaciated condition from having fasted, and fed only on their own
fat, for several months. The females remain with the pups until
they learn to swim and to catch fish for themselves, and about the
end of May they all leave the coast, only occasionally a groggy old
bull remaining behind for the winter months.”</p>

<p>Soon after the discovery of New Zealand by Cook the abundance
of the fur-seals on the coast led to the exploitation of this source
of wealth by sealers&mdash;many from Sydney, but others from far-distant
ports of Europe and America. Sealing from Sydney
appears to have commenced as early as 1791, but it was not till
1801 that the trade was “free to British subjects, as to foreigners,
although as a concession granted by a private company” (the East
India Company), according to Dr. McNab. Sir Joseph Banks, in
a memorandum on the “Present State of the Colony of Sidney, in
New South Wales,” dated the 4th June, 1806, says of the fur-seal,
“The island of Van Diemen, the south-west coast of New Holland,
and the southern parts of New Zealand produce seals of all kinds
in quantities at present almost innumerable. Their stations on
rocks or in bays have remained unmolested since the Creation.
The beach is incumber’d with their quantities, and those who visit
their haunts have less trouble in killing them than the servants of
the Victualling Office have who kill hogs in a pen with mallets.
While this is the case the utmost encouragement should be given to
those colonists who will embark in search of the seals....
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>There can be no doubt that at all times hereafter seals will be
attainable in great quantities&mdash;as is now the case in Newfoundland&mdash;by
stationary fishers, who know the courses they take in
their migrations, and can intercept them in their progress by nets
and other contrivances. Thus, if we encourage our new settlers to
disturb as speedily as possible every seal-station they can discover,
we shall receive from them an immense supply of skins and oil
in the first instance; shall prevent the interference of foreign
nations in future in the sealing fishery; and secure to ourselves
a permanent fishery hereafter, because it will be carried out by
means which none but stationary fishermen can provide.”</p>

<p>To show how far out Banks was in his estimate of the permanency
of the seal fishery, I may quote a sentence from a despatch
sent by Surgeon Luttrell to Under-Secretary Sullivan, dated the
8th October, 1807: “A few of the ships that have arrived have
had a Home freight of whale-oil and seal-skins, but the latter trade
is greatly on the decline, as the seals are all nearly destroyed on
the southern islands in this coast, or, from the constant molestation
they have suffered, have abandoned the islands.” In the course
of a parliamentary inquiry held in England in 1819 a Mr.
McDonald, who had been sealing on the New Zealand coast, gave
some evidence on this subject, from which I summarize the following:
The seals were taken at two different seasons, the best being
in April, when the pups are six months old, and the other about
Christmas, when the females come to the males. The pup seals
yield about 2 gallons of oil, and the “wigs,” or old males, from
5 to 6 gallons. The skins brought from 5s. to 8s. each. On the
first voyage he was out they brought over some 11,500 skins. Asked
if the skins were becoming scarce on the coast of New Zealand,
he stated that they were not, but they required to be well sought
after.</p>

<p>From 1803 to 1805 several small vessels visited the south and
south-west coasts of New Zealand and carried off many thousands
of seal-skins; but even by that date the seals must have been reduced
in numbers, and the sealers had turned their attention to the
Southern Islands. Thus in 1806 the American ship “Favourite”
reached Sydney with 60,000 seal-skins, said to have been obtained
on the “east coast of New Zealand.” As a matter of fact, they
were taken on Antipodes Island.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span></p>
<p>A Mr. Scott, on the authority of Mr. Morris, an old Sydney
sealer by profession, remarks that “to so great an extent was
this indiscriminate killing carried that in two years (1814–15)
no less than 400,000 skins were obtained from Penantipod, or
Antipodes Island, alone, and necessarily collected in so hasty a
manner that very many of them but were imperfectly cured. The
ship ‘Pegasus’ took home 100,000 of these in bulk, and on her
arrival in London the skins, having heated during the voyage,
had to be dug out of the hold, and were sold as manure&mdash;a sad
and reckless waste of life.”</p>

<p>Later on the Bounties were visited; then the Auckland Islands
were discovered and exploited; and still later the Campbell and
Macquarie Islands. It is quite impossible to arrive at any estimate
of the quantity of oil and seal-skins taken in this destructive trade;
and, further, many of the most successful sealers did not state
too definitely where they obtained their catches.</p>

<p>A letter written in Sydney about 1824 states that, “I do assert
of late the southern and western coasts of New Zealand have been
infested with Europeans and New-Zealanders who without consideration
have killed the pups before they are prime, and the
clapmatches before pupping, for the sake of eating their carcases,
the consequence of which is that the increase of [<i>sic</i>] seals will be
totally extinct in about three years on the coast. This circumstance
will illustrate what I am about to observe when I state that the seals
will not resort to the ground frequented by man.” According to
the late Dr. McNab, the great seal trade of New Zealand was practically
over by 1830. Captain Benjamin Morrell, of the American
schooner “Antarctic,” visited the Southern Islands in that year,
and here are his own words: “Although the Auckland Islands
once abounded with numerous herds of fur and hair seals, the
American and English seamen engaged in this business have made
such clean work of it as scarcely to leave a breed; at all events,
there was not one fur-seal to be found on the 4th January, 1830.
We therefore got under way on the morning of Tuesday, the 5th,
at 6 o’clock, and steered for another cluster of islands&mdash;or, rather,
rocks&mdash;called ‘the Snares.’... We searched them in vain for
fur-seal, with which they formerly abounded. The population was
extinct&mdash;cut off, root and branch.”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI"></a>CHAPTER XI.</h2>

<h3>CHIROPTERA&mdash;NEW ZEALAND BATS.</h3>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">How</span> many people&mdash;especially young people&mdash;in New Zealand have
seen native bats? Two species occur in the country, and one of
these at one time was fairly common. Now they are very rarely
seen in the settled districts. It is some years since I have seen
one in the Dunedin Town Belt, a locality in which they formerly
were common. In Hutton and Drummond’s “Animals of New
Zealand” it is said that “a peculiar interest is attached to these
creatures. One has become very rare; the other is on the brink
of extinction, and may, indeed, even now have ceased to exist.
They are popularly called the ‘short-tailed’ and the ‘long-tailed.’
As if to make up in one respect for deficiency in another,
short-tail has long ears, and long-tail has short ones.” I do not
think this estimate of their occurrence is a correct one. Bats still
occur in forest regions, and in the wide and quite unsettled areas
lying between the open country of Otago and Southland and the
West Coast Sounds it is quite probable that the short-tailed species
is still to be met with. The only people likely to come across bats
are the few explorers who traverse these almost unknown regions,
and bushfellers and sawmill hands, for these animals hide themselves
from all ordinary observers. Bats hide away in holes in
trees and in rock caves during the day, and even when flying at
night are not easily caught, unless one stretches out a white sheet,
when they sometimes flap right into it.</p>

<p>The short-tailed bat (<i>Mystacops tuberculatus</i>) seems to have first
been met with by Dr. Knox, of Auckland, who got one and presented
it to the British Museum in July, 1843. In 1871 he got
another, I think, in the Hutt Valley. In the same year, when
H.M.S. “Clio” was in Milford Sound, several of these bats were
caught when the sails were being hung out to dry. When Hutton
described this species in 1871 there were only two specimens in
the Colonial Museum&mdash;one from the Hutt Valley and the other from
the “Clio.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span></p>
<p>The feet of bats are peculiar. The toes are all about the same
length, and the first (or great) toe is nearly in a line with the others;
all are furnished with sharp claws. They are not fitted to walk
on the ground, but to grasp the branches of trees, and Hutton says
this species “has adaptations which led to the conclusion that it
hunts for its insect prey not only in the air, but also on the
branches and leaves of trees, among which its peculiarities of
structure must enable it to creep and crawl with ease and security.”
The length of this little bat is about 2·8 in., and the spread of its
wings about 12 in. Knox says of it, “A well-defined line ran
from the wrist-joint, sweeping round to the elbow, knee, and setting
on of the tail, dividing the wing-shaped pectoral extremity, so that
on the internal segment hair was developed, whilst on the external
segment the integumentary expansion was perfectly smooth, so that
when the forearm and hand was completely drawn in or retracted,
the tail being free, the animal resembled in every respect, even
in that of colour and short silky hair, a little mouse; and the
small, short thumb, with its peculiar nail, would rest on the
ground.”</p>

<p>The long-tailed, short-eared bat (<i>Chalinolobus morio</i>) is found
all over New Zealand. Hutton says of it, “Up to 1885 it was
common about Christchurch, but it is thought that the destruction
of the old wooden bridge over the Avon, where numbers used to
gather together, has driven it away. It measures about 2 in. in
total length, being slightly smaller than the other species, and is
about the same size as the ‘flitter-mouse,’ the commonest species
in England.” Knox gives rather larger dimensions for this bat.
One he measured was 3&frac12; in. long and had a spread of wing of
10·8 in. Buller, writing of these animals in 1892, says that both
species, according to the Maoris, live in communities, inhabiting
the cavernous interior of some dead and hollow tree, congregating
there in hundreds and thousands, and clinging to the sides in successive
tiers, packed so closely as to occupy the entire surface.</p>

<p>Mr. Caldwell, a District Surveyor, gave Buller the following
information about this bat: “I left Carterton, together with two
companions,” he said, “for a walk into the hills at the right-hand
side of the Waiohine, going by way of the Belvedere Road. We
got fairly up the hills by about 10 a.m., and climbed a high range
covered with black-birch. Getting warm we sat down on the moss
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>to rest. Then my attention was attracted by a smell of a kind I
had not noticed in the bush before, and one that reminded me of a
flying-fox camp in Queensland. I followed the smell for some distance
to a large birch-tree, with an opening about 4 ft. from the
ground. I had evidently traced the smell to its source, for at the
opening it was fairly stifling. I could see nothing, so I lighted
a bunch of dry leaves, and thrust it through the opening into the
tree. As I did this a bat flew out in my face, then another and
another. The smoke increased, and the bats streamed out in
hundreds. I had no means of computing the number; but one of
my men, having a small switch in his hand, kept striking at the
stream, the result of which I afterwards counted. There were
exactly a hundred bats killed. For one killed at least ten must
have passed and flown away. Large numbers dropped down in
clusters through the blazing opening. I had no idea there were
so many bats in the Wairarapa, and would not have believed it
had I not seen them. I have never seen in New Zealand another
such collection.” My first comment on reading this account was
disgust and indignation at the wanton slaughter of these rare and
inoffensive animals. Buller adds that “most unfortunately the
fire took possession of the tree, which was in a very dry and combustible
state, and the whole colony perished in the conflagration.”
It is no wonder these animals have become rare!</p>

<p>Cheeseman records numerous other instances of the great congregations
of these bats in bush-covered districts. Many hundreds
were found in a hollow tree in the Wangapeka Valley, Nelson, in
1881. Later on a colony of several hundreds was found in the
Thames; and in 1893 a bushfeller in the Kaipara district found
hundreds of them in a tree which he cut down. He brought twenty-two
of them alive in a box to Mr. Cheeseman, who, being anxious
to see how they would behave in a room with closed doors and
windows, liberated them. “The experiment justified to some
extent the belief that bats enjoy an acute sense of touch, probably
unequalled throughout the animal kingdom. They took to their
wings at once, and commenced to circle round the room with that
quick, soft, and noiseless flight which they are enabled to pursue
by means of their velvety wings. The presence of full daylight
did not affect them in the slightest degree, and they made no mistake
in estimating their distance from an object. They circled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>round the room, flying in and out of the corners, skimming just
below the ceiling, and hovering over the furniture, but never
coming in contact with anything. Nor did they dash themselves
against the window-panes, as birds would have done in similar
circumstances, but they treated the glass in precisely the same
manner as the walls of the room. After satisfying themselves that
there was no mode of escape from the room, they began to settle
down on the tops of the architraves of the doors and windows,
hanging, head downwards, by the claws of their forewings. Ultimately
they collected in clusters of four or five, cuddling quite
close to one another, and they were then easily transferred to their
cage.”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII"></a>CHAPTER XII.</h2>

<h3>RODENTIA&mdash;RATS.</h3>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> gnawing-animals, which constitute the order Rodentia, form
the most sharply defined group of the Mammalia, the distinguishing
characters and name being derived from their teeth. These
are of two kinds only&mdash;viz., incisors and grinders&mdash;there being
two efficient incisors in each jaw, and from three to six molars.
There are no canine teeth at all; consequently it is easy to recognize
the skull of a rodent by its dentition. The animals are mostly
small, the beaver being about the largest; while some kinds of mice
are hardly more than a couple of inches long.</p>

<p>Seven species of rodents have been introduced into this country
at one time or another. Of these, three species of rat, the mouse,
and the guinea-pig belong to the simple-toothed rodents&mdash;that is,
they never have at any period of their life more than two incisors
in the upper jaw. The rabbit and the hare belong to the double-toothed
rodents. These have each two large incisors in the upper
jaw, and behind them two small&mdash;almost rudimentary&mdash;incisors.</p>

<p>A species of rat was one of the four land-mammals occurring
in these islands when Captain Cook first visited New Zealand, the
others being a dog and two species of bats. Sir Joseph Banks says
in his Journal, “On every occasion when we landed in this country
we have seen, I had almost said, no quadrupeds originally natives
of it. Dogs and rats, indeed, there are&mdash;the former, as in other
countries, companions of men, and the latter probably brought
hither by the men. Especially as they are so scarce that I myself
have not had an opportunity of seeing even one.”</p>

<p>This was not Forster’s experience, for in his account of the
second voyage of Cook (in 1773) he says, “Our fellow-voyagers
[Furneaux in the ‘Adventure’] found immense numbers of rats
upon the Hippah Rock [Queen Charlotte Sound], so that they
were obliged to put some large jars in the ground level with
the surface, into which these vermin fell during the night by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>running backwards and forwards, and great numbers of them were
caught in this manner.” It is now almost certain that this native
rat was the same species (<i>Mus exulans</i>) as is still common in many
of the South Sea islands and throughout the Pacific, and it probably
came with the original immigrants, the ancestors of the
Morioris and Maoris. It is, however, probable that the common
European black rat (<i>Mus rattus</i>) came also into the country with
the various ships which touched at these shores from 1769 onwards.
Indeed, Yates, who wrote in 1835, says, “The Natives tell us that
rats were introduced in the first ship by Tasman.” He is certainly
not an authority on the subject, and too much importance need not
be attached to his statement; but it is nevertheless interesting.
In Cassell’s Natural History, Dallas, who writes on the Rodentia,
says, “New Zealand at the time of its discovery harboured a rat
known as the forest-rat, or Maori rat, which was a favourite
article of food with the Natives, and is now almost extinct. It
has been proved by Captain Hutton to be identical with our black
rat (<i>Mus rattus</i>), and was probably introduced by the ancestors of
the Maoris.”</p>

<p>I do not know when this was written, for Messrs. Cassell and Co.
take the precaution not to put dates on many of their books. But
Hutton, in vol. 20 of the “Transactions of the New Zealand
Institute” (1888), speaks of the rats which invaded Picton and the
Marlborough Sounds as <i>Mus maorium</i>, and says, “This rat is
certainly different from <i>Mus huegeli</i>, from Fiji, and, I should
think, from <i>M. exulans</i>.” The whole subject has recently been
investigated by Oldfield Thomas, who is the greatest living
authority in this group, and he is certainly of opinion that the
kiore, or Maori rat, was the common Pacific species, <i>M. exulans</i>.
Endless confusion occurs, however, among early writers in speaking
of rats and their species, and this must be borne in mind in
reading the accounts of these animals.</p>

<p>The Rev. R. Taylor&mdash;who is not always, however, a reliable
authority&mdash;says that this Maori rat was in general size about one-third
that of the brown, or Norway, rat. The Maoris used to make
elaborate preparations to catch them, and hundreds of them would
be captured at one hunting. He says the animal is reported to
run only in a straight line, and that the Maoris made special lines
of roads in order to lead them into their traps, which were baited
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>with miro and other berries. If these roads were crooked, they
said, the rats ran into the forest at the bends. They fed entirely
on vegetable matter, and were greatly prized as food by the Natives,
who also extracted much oil from them.</p>

<p>The native rat quickly disappeared before other rats and also
cats; it was extremely rare thirty or forty years ago, and is probably
quite extinct now. As, however, the species is common in
Polynesia, occasional immigrants may arrive in New Zealand from
time to time. The popular belief among both Maoris and
Europeans was that it was exterminated by the Norway rat (<i>Mus
decumanus</i>). It is, however, probable that the latter is a more
recent immigrant than the old European black rat, which is still
an extremely common animal here. That the Maori rat was once
very abundant seems to be proved by the fact that the Natives
always erected their storehouses for food on various kinds of piles
as a protection against the depredations of these animals. This
habit, according to Judge Mailing (“Pakeha Maori”), was the
custom before Europeans landed in the country.</p>

<p>Tancred, writing of Canterbury in 1856, says, “The native rat
forms numerous burrows, rendering the soil unsafe for a horse.”
He also repeats the statement about its being exterminated by
that formidable invader the Norway rat. Mr. W. T. L. Travers,
writing in 1869, says, “It has been the fashion to assume that
before the arrival of Europeans in this colony this creature [the
native rat] was common, and to attribute its destruction to the
European rat; and, indeed, the Natives have been credited with
a proverb in relation to this point. It is not in effect impossible
that the ultimate destruction of those which still existed when trade
was first opened between Europeans and the Natives, long after
the colonization of New Zealand, may have been hastened by the
introduction of the European rat; but I am satisfied that before
that time they had become very scarce, and, indeed, I have been
told by gentlemen who have lived in the northern part of this
[the South] Island for upwards of forty years that they never saw
a specimen.”</p>

<p>Speaking of Nelson in 1842, Judge Broad said, “Native rats
were an intolerable nuisance; they ate everything, ran about the
houses in the dark, and had no fear of man. They drove the cats
away, and only disappeared when rat-killing dogs were introduced.”
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>I do not think these were native rats at all, for the latter
ate only vegetable matter, and these vermin seemed to eat everything.</p>

<p>Dr. Hocken has an interesting statement in his “Early History
of New Zealand,” as follows: “In 1840 Messrs. Dodds and Davis,
of Sydney, established a farming settlement at Riccarton, close to
where Christchurch now stands, and sent down James Heriot (or
Hariot) as manager, two farm hands, and two teams of bullocks.
They ploughed and cultivated about 30 acres of land and secured
their crops. But in less than a year they decided to abandon all
further efforts. Numberless rats attacked the garnered stores, and
the bar at the mouth of the river or estuary proved a sad obstacle
to shipping whatever grain had been spared by the scourge of
rats.” We do not know now which species this was, though I
think it was probably the black rat.</p>

<p>It is rather interesting that in 1870 Sir Walter Buller wrote
a paper “On the New Zealand Rat,” and he both figured and
described the European black rat (<i>Mus rattus</i>). I have already
said that this rat probably arrived with some of the first ships
which came to the country. Oldfield Thomas in a paper written
in 1897 in the “Proceedings of the Zoological Society” says that
the rats normally inhabiting ships are not, as is commonly supposed,
<i>Mus decumanus</i>, but <i>Mus rattus</i>, and in most cases these are of
the grey variety of that animal, with white belly, though the black
form may often be caught in the same ship as the grey.</p>

<p>The black rat became enormously abundant in the early days
of settlement, and moved about the country in vast armies. The
settlers, bushfellers, and sawmill hands of fifty or seventy years
ago recorded how invasions of them in countless swarms used
to move through their district, climbing everywhere, and eating
everything before them that was of a vegetable nature. Oldfield
Thomas, in the article already referred to, says, “All the world
over <i>Mus rattus</i> takes to roofs and trees on meeting its formidable
rival, <i>Mus decumanus</i>, to which it leaves the gutters and
cellars.”</p>

<p>In early days in Southland we often heard about rat invasions,
and the popular belief then was that these were migrations of native
rats. I think there is little doubt that they were black rats, which
are not necessarily black-coloured. I propose to quote now from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>various writers on the subject, to show how common these rodents
were at times.</p>

<p>Taylor White states that on the west coast of the South Island
they came in vast crowds, climbed trees, tent poles and ropes, and
ate everything. On the shores of Lake Wakatipu they lived under
the dead leaves of the wild-spaniard or spear-grass (<i>Aciphylla
squarrosa</i> and <i>A. Colensoi</i>).</p>

</p>

<p>Rutland records how, in 1856, the district of Collingwood, on
the western side of Blind Bay, was visited by a swarm, and in
1863 he was informed of a swarm on the Shotover, Otago. I have
heard of this one also. Old miners used to tell how they were
nearly eaten out of provisions by an invasion of rats. Repeated
swarms occurred in Picton in 1872, 1878, 1880, 1884, and 1888.
Rutland says, “These rat-swarms invariably take place in spring.
A few of the animals appear in August; they increase in numbers
till November, when all disappear again gradually as they came.
While in a locality dead rats are seen lying about in all directions&mdash;on
roads, in gardens, and elsewhere. Very few have any marks
of violence on their bodies; nor have they died of hunger, since,
on examination, they are generally found fat. In 1884, in Picton,
forty-seven dead rats were found lying together under the floor of
the sitting-room in one house. In another thirty-seven were found
dead under the kitchen. The whole town was pervaded with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>odour of dead rats. The average weight of a full-grown specimen
is about 2 oz. The fur on the upper portion of the body is dark
brown, inclining to black; on the lower portion white or greyish-white.
They run awkwardly and slowly on the ground, but run
very quickly on the trees. When suddenly startled or pursued
they cry out with fear. The extremely few females that occur
amongst the countless hordes is a fact that shows that, if breeding
does take place at all during these periods of travel, it must be on
a very limited scale.”</p>

<p>I think a probable partial explanation of this problem is that
only the males migrate, while the females, which are producing
young at that very season&mdash;the beginning of spring&mdash;remain in
their usual haunts.</p>

<p>“They do little damage, their food being green vegetables.
Though they enter dwellinghouses and barns, it is evidently not
in quest of food, as shown by corn and other eatables being left
untouched by them.” Rutland adds, “Among English country
people, who have the best opportunity of observing them, it is
commonly asserted that in litters of young rats the males produced
outnumbered the females by about seven to one.”</p>

<p>Meeson describes a plague of rats in 1884: “Nelson and Marlborough&mdash;in
other words, the whole of the extreme northern portion
of the South Island of New Zealand&mdash;is enduring a perfect invasion.
Living rats are sneaking in every corner, scuttling across
every path; their dead bodies in various stages of decay, and in
many cases more or less mutilated, strew the roads, fields, and
gardens, pollute the wells and streams in all directions. Whatever
kills the animals does not succeed in materially diminishing
their numbers. Young and succulent crops, as of wheat and peas,
are so ravaged as to be unfit for and not worth the trouble of
cutting and harvesting. A young farmer the other day killed
with a stout stick two hundred in a couple of hours in his wheat-field.”
Among reasons suggested for the visitation he suggests the
pressure of famine: “Last summer was very wet, and last winter
very cold; the amount of snow lying on the high lands in the
interior was very great. Another is the excessive increase in numbers,
producing an intense struggle for existence.” It is thus seen
that his conclusions are somewhat different from those reached by
Mr. Rutland, who did not think that hunger was an impelling
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>cause. He goes on to say, “I have examined many of these
animals, and have not found a single female. One of my neighbours
has examined two hundred of them, and a Maori, at the pa
beyond Wakapuaka, one hundred, with the same negative result.
Some females have, however, been taken, and in one case they
were found breeding. He is more like a big field-mouse than a
Norway rat; and besides being considerably smaller he is slightly
darker in colour, and less malodorous. He climbs trees and flax-plants,
and is phytophagous rather than carnivorous.”</p>

<p>Hutton, writing in 1887, said, “The rat appears to have
invaded Picton at the end of March, and to have suddenly
disappeared by the 20th April. Old Maoris recognized it as the
rat they used to eat in former times, and said that swarming on
to the lowlands periodically was always characteristic of it. These
rats were often noticed climbing trees. In the Pelorus, where they
stopped longer, they built nests, like birds, in trees.”</p>

<p>Kingsley, in 1894, records it as nesting on the branches of
small trees, 4 ft. to 5 ft. from the ground, near Totaranui, and
gives examples from Motueka, Riwaka, Collingwood, Nelson, and
Taranaki. I myself have seen tall thorn hedges at Whangarei full
of their nests&mdash;large, shapeless structures, which at first I thought
must have been made by house-sparrows which had taken to building
in hedges.</p>

<p>At the present time black rats are extraordinarily common about
Christchurch. Mr. Speight, the curator, informed me three years
ago that Canterbury Museum was infested with them. A good deal
of the damage said to be done to orchards by opossums is almost
certainly the work of the black rat.</p>

<p>Marriner reports that he met with grey rats at North-west Bay
in Campbell Island, which Waite, of the Canterbury Museum,
thought were probably specimens of <i>Mus rattus</i>.</p>

<p>The brown, or Norway, rat (<i>Mus decumanus</i>) is ubiquitous, and,
though there is no record of its arrival in New Zealand, it no doubt
arrived here in the earliest days of settlement. Early in last century
Russell, or Kororareka, in the Bay of Islands, was the chief port of
the young colony, and rats must have become very abundant there.
Charles Darwin, who visited the Bay of Islands in 1835, says in
his account of the voyage of the “Beagle,” “It is said that the
common Norway rat, in the short space of two years, annihilated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>in this north end of the Island the New Zealand species.” Dieffenbach,
writing some time later, said he never could obtain a native
rat, “owing to the extermination carried on against it by the
European rat.” There is no doubt that this species has had a considerable
share in the destruction of the native avifauna, and it
is also responsible for much of the difficulty experienced by acclimatization
societies and private individuals in their attempts to
establish introduced game-birds, but I do not think it is responsible
for the disappearance of the Maori rat.</p>

<p>During visits to Stewart Island and the West Coast Sounds
between 1874 and 1880 I was struck by the abundance of these
animals in regions uninhabited and almost unvisited by man. One
day I remember that the late Mr. Robert Paulin and I emerged
from the bush on the south side of Thule, in Paterson Inlet, when
the tide was low, exposing a wide stretch of beach nearly a mile
long. We were much impressed by noticing that the whole beach
was alive with large rats, which were feeding on the shell-fish and
stranded animals which the tide had left exposed. As soon as
they saw us they ran for the shelter of the bush; they were literally
in hundreds. I am inclined to think that the rat which frequents
all sheltered beaches on the coast is this common brown rat, and
that it depends on the animal life of the sea-coast for its livelihood.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span></p>
<p>In 1868 H. H. Travers reported these brown rats as very
abundant in the Chatham Islands; and Captain Bollons, of the
“Hinemoa,” states that they are very numerous round the homestead
on Campbell Island.</p>

<p>A few years ago, when a scare arose about the bubonic plague,
a feeble and intermittent crusade against rats was inaugurated,
especially in Auckland; but it was, as might have been expected,
absolutely futile. It is, of course, well known that rats are the
carriers of the plague germs, or at least that they harbour the
fleas which are the real carriers. In the fifth and sixth chapters
of I Samuel there is a very interesting account of the plague which
attacked the cities of Philistia, and which produced emerods&mdash;that
is, haemorrhoids or swollen glands&mdash;as a conspicuous symptom.
The lords of the Philistines, in sending back the ark of God to the
Israelites, because they thought it was the cause of the malady
which affected them, accompanied it by models of emerods in gold,
and also golden mice. These were probably golden rats, and seem
to show that in these early days, three thousand years ago, the
connection between the plague and the rats was well recognized.</p>

<p>While brown rats are still very abundant, especially about the
towns, there is no doubt that the spread of weasels throughout the
country has vastly diminished their numbers, especially in the
open, for a weasel prefers a rat to a rabbit any day.</p>

<h3>RODENTIA&mdash;MICE AND GUINEA-PIGS.</h3>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Mouse</span> (<i>Mus musculus</i>).</h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">It</span> is probable that the mouse was introduced into New Zealand
early in last century, yet the first notice of the appearance of
this familiar little animal in the North Island is recorded by
Dieffenbach, who wrote as late as 1839. Pastor Wohlers, long a
missionary working among the Natives on Ruapuke, in Foveaux
Strait, states that mice were first brought to that island in the
“Elizabeth Henrietta,” which was wrecked there in 1824, and that
even as late as 1873 they continued to be known as “henriettas.”
The late Mr. Robert Gillies, who arrived in Otago in 1848, writing
in 1872, says that it is quite certain there were no mice in Otago
in 1852; but a year or perhaps two years after they were noticed,
in Dunedin first. They quickly travelled south, but the Molyneux
stopped their migration for a time, and it was considerably later
before Molyneux Island (Inch-Clutha) was touched by them. Taylor
White speaks of mice appearing in the Canterbury Plains in the
early days of settlement (from 1855 onwards) “suddenly in
thousands.” In 1866, during a discussion which arose at a meeting
of the Canterbury Acclimatization Society as to the reported
destruction of small birds by hawks, Mr. W. T. L. Travers reported
“that he had opened a large number of hawks, and in all cases
found their food to consist entirely of mice and grasshoppers.”</p>

<p>The mouse has never been found very far from the haunts of
men, either in this country or elsewhere. It is abundant in all
settled parts, and is also common on the Auckland, Antipodes,
and Campbell Islands. Though it follows man so closely, it frequently
stays in localities where men have been and have left, and
there it is apt to have a bad time. Mr. Philpott, writing to me
on the 2nd January, 1918, said, “There is a plague of mice in
the district west of the Waiau. From Bluecliff to the Knife and
Steel, near the Big River and beyond, each hut [the Government
huts on the now abandoned telephone track to Puysegur Point]
was overrun with them. And not only at the huts, but on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>beach and in the dense bush, wherever we went, they were plentiful.
At the Hump, near Lake Hauroto, they were as numerous as elsewhere.
This prevalence of mice is certainly not usual; I have
been on the Hump four or five times since 1911, and last year
tramped along to the Knife and Steel, but, apart from an odd
one or two, no mice were in evidence on former trips. One noticeable
thing about these little creatures was their boldness: they
were evidently very hungry. The wekas caught many of them,
swallowing them whole, head first.”</p>

<p>How terrible a pest these rodents can be is shown by the state
of affairs which has prevailed in the wheat-growing districts of
Australia during the past season or two. The following note,
taken from the Melbourne <i>Age</i> of the 17th July, 1917, gives some
idea of the dimensions the pest has reached: “At Brooklyn there
are nearly seven million bags of wheat, forming three and a
half miles of stacks, and it is estimated that close on two million
bags have yet to be railed thither from country stations. At Spotswood
three million bags, most from the 1915–16 crop, are stacked....
The mouse plague in its myriads has attacked the Brooklyn
stacks. The very air reeks with the smell of the mice, dead and
alive. Daily to Brooklyn roll from seven hundred to eight hundred
railway-trucks, loaded at the country stations mainly in the mouse-riddled
areas of the Wimmera and the Mallee. From the Goulburn
Valley the trucks bring with them, it is observed, mice that are
few in comparison with those from the Wimmera and the Mallee.
Every truck from these two regions contributes its mice to the
swarming community at Brooklyn. And of the manner of the reception
of these mice the instances afforded on an inspection on a
week-day are at least suggestive. The average truck, when rolled
alongside the wheat-stacks, is received by a handful of labourers.
The bags are hauled up by tackle from truck to stack. When the
last bag is lifted the doors of the truck are thrown open, and the
chaff and the spoilt wheat broomed out. With the waste come flying
out the mice&mdash;no great number in some trucks, but, clearly, on
the average delivery of trucks a day, adding hundreds of mice to
the pest, which has bitten deeply into the stacks at Brooklyn.
Scattering, scampering, the mice race down the rails. A fox-terrier
or two, wearing a <i>blasé</i> demeanour, condescend to catch a couple
of mice as an example to the others. The rest of the new arrivals
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>find shelter in the base of the wheat-stacks, or the low pile of damp,
reeking bags of wheat awaiting reconditioning. Little if any
effort seems to be made by the labourers to check the pest in an
ordinary truck; and, indeed, a great deal of effort would be needed
to be effective, and the reception and despatch of trucks must be
inevitably delayed. Only when a badly infested truck, smeared
with the flour of mouse-gnawn wheat, announces its contents by a
vile reek of rotting mouse&mdash;an announcement beyond all risk of
contradiction&mdash;it is detached, hauled off to another track, and left
loaded to await special treatment.”</p>

<p>Two methods are adopted in Victoria to cope with the pest in
the wheat-trains. One is to plug all the holes in the truck, place
a sack in each corner with its mouth propped open with an iron
hoop, and then proceed to lift the bags of wheat out of the truck
on to the stack. The escaping mice jump into the sacks until
they are nearly half-full. But if the mice are too numerous to
be dealt with in this way, then they are gassed in the truck.
I am not sure whether carbon disulphide or carbon dioxide is employed&mdash;probably
the former. This takes at least an hour, and
perhaps ten thousand mice are afterwards shovelled out of each
truck; and, as hundreds of trucks full of wheat were arriving at
Brooklyn each day, it is easily seen that the plague certainly was
not stayed. What happens at Brooklyn has been happening in
other parts of Australia, and we may be thankful that in New
Zealand we have no such gigantic pests to cope with.</p>

<p>As the mouse breeds all the year round and produces five or
six young at a birth, its rapid increase under favourable circumstances
is easily understood.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Guinea-pig</span> (<i>Cavia porcellus</i>).</h3>

<p>On the banks of the Rio de la Plata, and in the country lying
to the northwards, a little animal, considered by many naturalists
to be the wild form from which our domesticated guinea-pig is
derived, is found in thousands. It is known as the “restless
cavy.” It generally lives in moist situations, usually near the
border of the forest, but never in the forest itself or in the open
fields. Other authorities consider that the name “guinea-pig” is
a corruption of Guiana-pig, and that the first specimens may have
come from that part of America. The prevalent colours of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>guinea-pig, as is well known, are white, black, and yellow, and in
this respect it differs a good deal from the “restless cavy.”</p>

<p>It is hardly correct to include the guinea-pig among the wild
animals of New Zealand, as, although it has been frequently
liberated, it has never succeeded in establishing itself. At one
time I had a number of guinea-pigs running wild in my garden
in Maori Hill, and noticed that violets growing among the grass
increased remarkably all the time they were about. The guinea-pigs
kept the grass very closely nibbled, but would not touch the
violets. These animals had a well-sheltered run under a thick
mass of periwinkle which grew along a raised bank. They throve
remarkably till a host of little ones, not much bigger than the
end of one’s thumb, began to appear. This was too much for the
cats in the neighbourhood. These creatures began to haunt the
garden day and night. They soon ate all the little ones, and,
having acquired a taste for this kind of game, they never stopped
till they had destroyed all the stock but a few old bucks. There
is no reason why guinea-pigs should not become wild in this country,
except for the prevalence of cats.</p>

<p>The only record I find of the introduction of these animals into
this country is by the Auckland Acclimatization Society in 1869;
but they have been repeatedly brought in by dealers for the last
fifty or sixty years. I believe that guinea-pigs are very good for
food, for they are very dainty feeders. But there is a considerable
prejudice against them on the part of most people. I had a bachelor
acquaintance in London who used to give very <i>recherché</i> dinners
to his male friends. On one occasion they got a dish of a new and
very palatable kind, which they all enjoyed, until they learned
that they had been eating guinea-pig, when some of them highly
resented their host’s experimenting upon them. But it was only
prejudice from which they suffered. They reminded me of the
lady who enjoyed stewed eel until she learned what she had been
eating, when she promptly retired from the table and managed
to get sick.</p>

<p>The family of the cavies, to which the guinea-pig belongs, is
chiefly characterized by the form of the teeth. The fore feet have
four and the hind feet three toes, all armed with hoof-like nails.
The tail is rudimentary or wanting; hence the common warning
to children that if one lifts a guinea-pig by the tail the eyes will
drop out.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV"></a>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>

<h3>RODENTIA&mdash;RABBITS.</h3>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Everybody</span> in New Zealand knows something about rabbits; a great
many know a good deal about their habits, their value for fur and
for gastronomic purposes, and their destructiveness; but very few
know about the history of their introduction.</p>

<p>Probably every one knows that the rabbit (<i>Lepus cuniculus</i>) is
a burrowing-animal, which thrives particularly in more or less dry
regions. A wet climate does not suit it, and although there are
regions in New Zealand where rabbits are to be met with but only
rarely, yet, as a general rule, they are particularly abundant where
there is a limited annual rainfall. They increase at a great rate,
the female producing several litters of young in a season, and
commencing to breed when about six months old. The young are
born blind and naked, and are housed by the mother in a warm
nest which is lined with fur pulled from her own body.</p>

<p>Rabbits have long been domesticated, and several well-marked
breeds have been developed. For example, in the “lop-eared,” the
ears are large flaps pendent on each side of the head, and often
touching the ground. They are of many colours&mdash;white, black,
brown, and fawn&mdash;sometimes of one nearly uniform hue, but more
often mixed. It is clear that many of our New Zealand wild
rabbits are descended from tame ones, for they still retain their
mixed colours. Albinos, with white fur and pink eyes, form a
distinct variety by themselves, and breed true. The Angora rabbits
have long fur, and are nearly always albinos.</p>

<p>The introduction of the rabbit into New Zealand has produced
such far-reaching effects and wrought such changes throughout the
country that it requires more than the sober language of the
naturalist to describe them. One thing is quite certain&mdash;namely,
that the animal was deliberately introduced into the country not
by one individual, but by numbers of persons, and by several
acclimatization societies. But no one will accept the blame for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>their introduction, so I may as well detail all the facts known to
me about their early history in New Zealand.</p>

<p>According to the Rev. Richard Taylor, author of “Te Ika a
Maui,” the early missionaries were the first to introduce rabbits
into the country; but, unfortunately, he gives no dates. If he
is correct, however, they were almost certainly brought from
New South Wales to the far northern part of the colony between
1820 and 1830. They probably never increased to any great
extent, for, though there are rabbits in a few localities north of
Whangarei (I will specify localities later), they are scarcely a pest
there.</p>

<p>I am told that Jerningham Wakefield reported them as being
placed on Mana and Kapiti Islands, in Cook Strait, in 1840 or
1841, but I cannot find any verification of the record. The first
definite notice I have discovered is in Mr. Tuckett’s diary of his
expedition to the South Island, which is printed as an appendix
to Dr. Hocken’s “Contributions to the Early History of New Zealand.”
Speaking of the country between the mouths of the Clutha
and Mataura Rivers, Tuckett writes, under date the 19th May,
1944, “Palmer has grown wheat and barley as well as potatoes,
and has plenty of fine fowls and ducks and some goats....
Returning from Tapuke [Taukupu], we landed on the island, and,
with the assistance of a capital beagle, caught six rabbits alive
and uninjured.” He does not say whether any were liberated on
the mainland, nor whether it was possible for those on the island
to get ashore.</p>

<p>Mr. James Begg, who has given me some very valuable information
as to the earliest attempts to introduce these animals, tells
me that “when Willsher and party settled at Port Molyneux in
the early ‘forties’ they sent to Sydney for rabbits, but whether
they obtained them or not I am unable to say. From early days
there was at least one colony of rabbits on the upper Waitaki.
These remained quite local in their habits, and did not increase
to any great extent. They were finally overwhelmed by the invasion
of the grey rabbit from the south. The late Mr. Telford, of Clifton,
introduced some rabbits and bred them in hutches till they numbered
about fifty. They were then liberated on Clifton, near the
banks of the Molyneux, but died out in a short time. This was
about the year 1864. Mr. Clapcott also liberated some at the old
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>homestead at Popotunoa Station [Clinton], but they also failed to
thrive, and disappeared. It is probable that there were other
attempts to acclimatize rabbits, all more or less unsuccessful.”</p>

<p>From the point of view of a naturalist the failure of these
attempts is very interesting. It shows that there is a vast difference
in the aggressive power of the various breeds, for the country
on which these various lots of rabbits failed to make good has
since been completely overrun by other rabbits. It may be that
they were unable to establish themselves until a certain amount
of clearing had been done, and till a considerable number of wekas
had been destroyed by tussock fires and other means. Whatever
the cause, it is the case that no rabbits were able to establish themselves
freely in New Zealand before 1860.</p>

<p>Dr. Menzies, who was at the time Superintendent of the Province
of Southland, is usually credited with having been the
successful introducer of them to the south of the South Island, an
achievement the credit of which has not been very eagerly sought
after. They were liberated on the sandhills between the ocean and
the New River, a place known as Sandy Point.</p>

<p>According to Mr. Huddlestone, silver-grey rabbits were first
introduced into Nelson in or about 1865; but there is no record
as to what came of this importation. Sir George Grey also appears
to have introduced them at or about the same time, for in the
annual report of the Canterbury Acclimatization Society in 1866
it is said that “an enclosure has been set apart for the silver-grey
rabbits presented by Sir George Grey, which have thriven well and
increased to a great extent, and <i>have been distributed to members
far and near</i>.” Later in the same year the society passed this
minute: “The suggestion of giving as a reward for the destruction
of hawks and wild cats some silver-grey rabbits was approved.”</p>

<p>There is a very popular impression that the Otago Acclimatization
Society has no responsibility in connection with the rabbit
plague. Well, here are the figures taken from one of their own
reports: “In 1866 the society liberated sixty rabbits, twenty-three
in 1867, and eighteen in 1868. There is no record as to where
these came from.”</p>

<p>These are the only records I have been able to secure so far as
to the introduction of rabbits into this colony, but there is still
a source of information to be searched&mdash;namely, the publications
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>of the Provincial Government of Southland. But there can be no
doubt, I think, that what happened in the south happened elsewhere
at every port where settlement took place, and that private
individuals at Nelson, Wellington, New Plymouth, and Napier
also imported rabbits. But when the animals became a pest, and
their increase was recognized to be a calamity to the country, every
one was desirous of repudiating the responsibility for their introduction.
Thus the framer of the annual report of the Canterbury
Society for 1889, not having read the statement in the report for
1866, says, concerning “the rabbit, that great scourge to our
large runholders&mdash;that the introduction of these cannot be laid to
the charge of this society.” Similarly, Mr. A. Bathgate, of Dunedin,
in 1897, wrote, “It is to them [the Provincial Government
of Southland] that we are indebted for the presence of the rabbit.”</p>

<p>The repudiation of the responsibility for the rabbits is almost
as funny as that for the sparrows. As soon as an animal turns out
differently from what was expected of it, and becomes a pest instead
of a blessing, then no one will admit having had anything to do
with the initial mistake of bringing it into the country.</p>

<p>From 1866 onwards the spread of the rabbits was phenomenal.
I quote part of Mr. Begg’s account of this increase: “About the
year 1874 they began to make their presence felt in an unpleasant
manner. By 1878 they had reached Lake Wakatipu, leaving a
devastated country behind them. At the same time they had
reached as far east as the Clutha River, and in a few years later
had overrun the greater part of Otago as well as the whole of
Southland. Those were evil days for farmers in that part of New
Zealand, and especially for the squatters, who occupied large areas
of grazing-country. The fine natural grasses on which the sheep
and cattle grazed were almost totally destroyed. Sheep perished
from starvation by hundreds of thousands, and it is no exaggeration
to say that the majority of the squatters were ruined. On
the old Burwood Station the number of sheep fell in one year from
119,000 to 30,000. This was partly due to heavy snow, but the
rabbits prevented any recovery. It is doubtful if the same country
to-day carries more than 40,000 sheep. From the year 1878
onwards immense areas of grazing-land were abandoned, as the
owners gave up the unequal struggle with the rabbits. In
the early days hunting with dogs, shooting, digging out the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>warren, poisoning with various baits, and trapping were the
methods by which farmers tried to rid themselves of the pest.
Later, wire netting, the introduction of stoats, weasels, and ferrets,
fumigating the burrows with poisonous gases (such as carbon
disulphide and hydrocyanic acid), and the stimulus given to
trapping by the export trade in frozen rabbits, have been relied
upon to reduce their numbers. In the writer’s experience practically
no progress was made in reducing the numbers of rabbits
till about the year 1895. From that year there has been a steady
diminution. For twenty years the rabbits had the upper hand,
and, though many millions were killed annually, no reduction in
their abundance was noticeable. In the last twenty years there
has been a steady decrease. Large areas of hill country in the
wetter districts are now completely clear of rabbits, though they
still persist in favourable situations. In the dry country in
Central Otago they are still very troublesome and very vigorous,
and their evil effects are there seen on hundreds of square miles
of country, once the finest grazing-land in New Zealand, now little
better than a desert.”</p>

<p>It must not be assumed that every one regards the rabbit as a
nuisance. Many a successful farmer of to-day got a start as a
rabbiter. The killing of rabbits actually became one of the principal
industries of the province. Their presence directly led to
the subdivision of large estates, and may have been quite as effective
in this direction as all the legislation on the subject. Since the
war rabbit-skins have become extraordinarily valuable, so that,
instead of landholders paying for the destruction of rabbits,
rabbiters offer premiums for permission to go on to land to trap
the rabbits.</p>

<p>The introduction of rabbits had a lasting effect on acclimatization
generally. Before their advent partridges and pheasants
had become numerous, but they have entirely disappeared in Otago.
In the effort to cope with the rabbits the country was annually
sown with poisoned grain. This had a disastrous effect on both
native and imported game. Had rabbits not become a nuisance
it is unlikely that weasels and other vermin would have been introduced.
These animals are largely responsible for the decrease
in the numbers of native birds, and also make the successful introduction
of new varieties more difficult.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span></p>
<p>The economic waste caused by the vast increase of rabbits in
New Zealand is incalculable, and certainly represents a loss in the
stock-carrying capacity of the country which probably runs every
year into millions of pounds. It is not only that they eat up
food which would support some millions more sheep than are at
present reared, but they destroy large areas of country, and yield
very little return for the damage they do. The annual export
of approximately three million rabbits, valued at (in pre-war times)
about £70,000, and of some eight millions of skins, valued at
about £115,000, is all the return they give, but it represents only
a small proportion of the pest. In all parts where rabbits abound
their destruction entails a heavy expense on the occupiers of the
land. There are no data available to enable any one to estimate
how many rabbits are destroyed every year, but far more are
killed by phosphorus than by trapping. The latter method alone
furnishes any statistical data; the former is an unknown quantity,
but it represents a very large figure.</p>

<p>Probably the most ghastly exhibition of the work of rabbits is
to be found in the grass-denuded districts of Central Otago, parts
of which have been reduced to the condition of a desert. It is
improbable that this state of affairs could have been brought about
by rabbits alone. Before their advent the runholders who had
possession of the arid regions, in which the rainfall probably
averages 10 in. to 12 in. annually, and certainly never exceeds
15 in., were doing their best to denude the surface of the ground
by overstocking with sheep and by frequent burning. The latter
was resorted to because many of the large tussock-forming grasses,
especially such as the silver-tussock (<i>Poa caespitosa</i>), yielded coarse
and rather unpalatable fodder, but after burning the tufts a crop
of tender green leaves sprung up, which were very readily eaten.
Unfortunately the burning not only got rid of most of the coarse
growth of the tussocks, but it also swept off the numerous bottom
grasses which occupied the intervening spaces, which were the
mainstay of the depasturing flocks. Even before the rabbits
arrived the work of denudation of the grass covering had been
proceeding apace through the causes mentioned. Thus Buchanan,
writing in 1865, said, “It is no wonder that many of the runs
require 8 acres to feed one sheep, according to an official estimate.”
Mr. Petrie thought this an unduly severe estimate, “as in the mid-‘seventies’
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>the sheep-runs of Central Otago were reputed to carry
at least one sheep to 3 acres, or somewhat less.”</p>

<p>Mr. Petrie, who has reported to the Department of Agriculture
on these grass-denuded lands of Central Otago, knows more about
this subject than any one else who has written on it, and I quote
him at some length. He says, “Before the rabbit invasion began
the hill-slopes carried a fairly rich and varied covering of tussock
and other grasses, and, except on the steeper rock and sun-baked
faces, had not been seriously depleted even in the early ‘nineties.’
The earlier stages of this depletion may now be seen in several of
the Central Otago ranges, as on the spurs of the Rough Ridge and
the Morven Hills districts. The northern slopes of the spurs are
almost, in many instances, entirely bare of grass, while the southern
shaded slopes still carry a fair amount of pasture. The grass
covering generally stops abruptly at the bottoms of the valleys,
even when those are not worn into water-channels. The vastly
greater depletion of the pasture on the northern slopes is easy
enough to understand. They are more exposed to the sun and to
the frequent violent parching north-west winds; they lose their
covering of snow earlier in spring than the southern slopes, and
are thus more closely grazed at a critical season for the pasture;
and sheep at all times show a preference for feeding on the warmer
sunny slopes. When the pasture on the exposed slopes fails, that
on the shaded slopes has to feed all the stock that is about, and
unless the stocking is reduced to meet the new conditions the remaining
grasses are sooner or later eaten out. The desert, with
all its problems, is then established.”</p>

<p>In his account of how desert conditions arise in Central Otago
Mr. Petrie refers only to the effects produced by sheep, because it
is the loss in sheep-carrying capacity which is so serious; but
later on, after describing a typical specimen of the country, and
showing that in inaccessible situations a considerable variety of
vigorous grasses live on, he adds, “This is one of the facts that
go to indicate that the extermination of the grasses in this desert
country is mainly due to eating out by overstocking, rabbits as
well as sheep being included among the stock carried....
The desert and the greatly denuded lands are not wholly destitute
of vegetation. In most of their lower areas greyish, flattened,
firm, nearly circular patches of scabweed (<i>Raoulia australis</i> and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span><i>R. lutescens</i>) are thickly dotted about the bare ground. Though
otherwise useless, these moss-like composite plants help to keep the
soil from being blown or washed away, and when old supply, in
the decayed centres of the patches, spots with some amount of humus
where grass-seeds can more readily settle and grow.” These plants
are never eaten by either sheep or rabbits.</p>

<p>In regard to other native plants, rabbits have nearly exterminated
the wild spear-grasses (<i>Aciphylla squarrosa</i> and <i>A. Colensoi</i>),
which used to be so abundant. They particularly attack these
plants when the ground is covered with snow. Mr. Petrie, writing
me three years ago, said, “When I first visited inland Otago, in
1874, <i>Aciphylla Colensoi</i> was most abundant. In riding about it
was almost impossible to deviate from well-beaten tracks or roads
because the spines pricked the legs and feet of the horses.” In
later years these plants have become rare. Captain Hutton,
writing me in March, 1892, said, “As to the extermination of the
wild-spaniards (<i>Aciphylla</i>), I believe it to be due to rabbits. When
I was in the Nelson District in 1872–73 there were no rabbits on
the eastern side of the Upper Wairau near Tarndale, but they were
abundant on the western side. Spaniards were abundant on the
eastern side, but almost destroyed on the western. The rabbits
seemed to burrow under the plants, and then eat the roots.”</p>

<p>Several species of <i>Celmisia</i> (notably <i>C. densiflora</i>) have been
greatly checked, and others are almost exterminated. Mr. B. C.
Aston, in his ascent of the Kaimanawas in 1914–15, found that
at a height of 4,200 ft. <i>Panax Colensoi</i> was nearly exterminated by
rabbits, which had ring-barked all the young trees. This mischief
is done after heavy falls of snow, when the rabbits are driven down
from the tussock-land into the gullies of the scrub and forest zones.
Trees of <i>Panax Edgerleyi</i> from 19 ft. to 20 ft. high were found to
be ring-barked and dead.</p>

<p>In a good many rabbit-infested districts, particularly in the
North Island, these animals have aided very materially in producing
a certain amount of erosion and washing-down of alluvium
by burrowing extensively in the banks of rivers and small streams.
When floods came down, these undermined portions were commonly
swept away where the firmer banks resisted the impact of the
water. Dr. C. A. Cotton, of Wellington, considers that this action
has caused a slight rejuvenation of erosion in certain districts
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>and river-systems. Cattle, sheep, and goats assist in this work,
but rabbits are the most active agents in it. The Rev. A. Don,
writing to me in 1901, said, “The rabbits, by stripping the ground
of vegetation and burrowing into the faces of the slopes, are converting
what were once nice green hillsides into shingle-slopes,
because when once the face is so bared and its surface broken it
begins to slip.” Mr. Petrie also refers to this process in his report,
as follows: “The soil on the grass-denuded slopes, which is by
no means infertile, being no longer held together by the roots of
plants, is being rapidly removed by wind and rain, and pebbles
and angular stones are now closely dotted over great stretches of
hillside that not many years ago were covered with soil. On the
steeper slopes, indeed, the soil is being rapidly sluiced down into
the gullies and thence into the river, and deep, narrow, chasm-like
watercourses are being dug out.”</p>

<p>I was at one time under the impression that in this new country,
where the causes&mdash;especially the natural enemies&mdash;which kept them
in check in their original home were wanting, and there seemed
to be nothing to arrest their development in any direction, there
might arise new varieties of rabbits, with modified habits, structure,
&amp;c. Particularly did it seem likely that colour variations
would thrive unchecked, and the traveller passing through certain
districts in Otago is certainly surprised at the number of conspicuously
coloured animals to be seen. I was down at Romahapa
recently and saw some rabbits at the edge of the bush, and among
a dozen of them there were some with white, buff, and black.
I was informed also that there are a number of them in the district
with a white ruff round the neck. Other observers bear me out
in the prevalence of coloured varieties among the wild rabbits.
Thus Mr. W. H. Gates, of Skipper’s, a keen observer of nature,
writing me two years ago, said, “As for colour, they are of all
colours&mdash;grey-and-white, tan-and-white, grey with a black ridge
down the backbone, grey with a white ring round their necks,
cream with a darker shade down the backbone, and buff.” Other
observers speak of the prevalence of black, black-and-white, and
yellow rabbits. Grey is certainly the best colour to hide a rabbit
in sandy ground covered with somewhat dry herbage, and in a
district like Central Otago, where rabbits are as “thick as locomotives”&mdash;as
a certain Gaelic acquaintance of mine with a limited
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>knowledge of English and of locusts put it&mdash;one can almost walk
over the rabbits, as long as they sit still, without seeing them.
The warning white tail of the rabbit is a danger-signal to other
rabbits, for whenever a rabbit is running for shelter its white
scut warns all the others which it passes to run also. To find out
with some approximation of accuracy whether my idea of the prevalence
of coloured rabbits was correct or not, I applied to Mr. R. S.
Black, of Dunedin, who is a very large exporter of rabbit-skins,
for information. Mr. Black informed me that, while they are of
all colours, yet 95 per cent. of the skins exported are grey.
The other colours appeal to the eye, but they are not so common,
after all.</p>

<p>That the rabbits of aberrant colours should survive is not to
be wondered at, seeing that in this country there are no foxes,
and neither owls nor hawks large enough or active enough to
tackle a full-grown rabbit. The common harrier hawk takes a
considerable toll of young rabbits, but is quite unable to keep them
in check. In many districts wild cats live mainly on rabbits.</p>

<p>I have from the far north an interesting record of a curious
habit among rabbits. Mr. Yarborough, of Kohukohu, writing in
August, 1916, tells me that rabbits became quite common in a district
near Kawakawa, at the head of the Bay of Islands, many years
ago. Recently they have reached the eastern side of the Hokianga
River, and it is not unusual to see them occasionally. Then he
adds this interesting statement: “I have never heard of any
rabbit-burrows, as they appear to breed among the rocks and
roots of trees.” Another observer from an adjacent district says
that these animals are not uncommon near Kaikohe, where they
do make shallow burrows. The comparatively heavy rainfall of
Hokianga, amounting to from 60 in. to 70 in. in a year, has no
doubt a good deal to do with the comparative scarcity of the rabbit
in that part of New Zealand.</p>

<h3>RODENTIA&mdash;HARES; INSECTIVORA&mdash;HEDGEHOGS.</h3>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Hare</span> (<i>Lepus europaeus</i>).</h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Hares</span>, like rabbits, are animals destitute of any special means of
defence against their enemies except the rapidity of their movements,
and they are exceedingly shy and timid. Their eyes and
ears are instantly cognisant of even distant warnings of danger,
and the limbs are admirably adapted for the most rapid flight.
The hind limbs are nearly twice as long as the fore limbs, and are
very muscular. Owing to their great length the animal, when
moving slowly in search of food, goes awkwardly about, “but
the moment there is occasion for him to move rapidly the disproportionate
hind limbs stand him in good stead, and he shoots
along the ground by a series of long leaps and with great swiftness.
At the same time, it is observed that the length of its hind
legs causes the hare to run with much greater facility uphill than
down, and in fact it is said that in descending steep inclines the
animal is obliged to run obliquely in order to escape overbalancing
itself. When pursued the hare has the art of making sudden turns
in its course, known as ‘doubles’ or ‘wrenches,’ by which the
dogs in chase of it are thrown out. Greyhounds are swifter of
foot than hares, but they are incapable of changing their course
so sharply, and thus, while they are carried some distance onwards
by their own impetus, their intended victim is making off
in a different direction.”</p>

<p>Hares can swim well, and have been seen crossing an arm of
the sea a mile wide. Hares do not burrow, but live in a small
hollow on the surface of the ground, which is known as the “form.”
They select a shady spot in summer, a sunny one in winter, and go
under cover when it rains. They live chiefly in cultivated country,
but in New Zealand are not uncommon on grass-land and on river-beds,
though I have met with them far up the slopes of Mount
Egmont. They feed on most vegetable materials.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span></p>
<p>Hares begin to breed when they are about a year old, and produce
several broods each year, each consisting of from two to five
young. I have been informed that in New Zealand hares usually
produce three or four young in a litter, whereas in England they
seldom have more than two. It is also stated that the animals are
larger here than in Britain. Both statements require verification,
but if these are facts they are probably due only to the abundance
of the food-supply.</p>

<p>It is just about fifty years since hares were first introduced into
New Zealand, and the most remarkable thing about this fact is
that the numbers originally brought here were so small. The
Otago Acclimatization Society appear to have been the first to bring
them here. They got three from Geelong, in Victoria, in 1867,
and liberated them at Waihola, where two years later they were
reported to be plentiful. Another was obtained in 1868, and three
more in 1875. The Canterbury Society got two in 1868 and four
in 1873. The Southland Society imported some (the number is not
recorded) in 1869 from Victoria, two more in 1871, and two in
1874, and then forty in 1887. The Nelson Society introduced
some (again the number is not specified) in 1872, and it is stated
that these increased so rapidly as to become a nuisance in the
district. These are all the records I can find of importations from
abroad into the South Island, and, considering the casual manner
and small numbers in which they were introduced, their subsequent
increase is most remarkable. They soon spread all over the flatter
parts of the Island, keeping mostly about cultivated land, and
especially in districts where rabbits were not abundant. They are
now common from Foveaux Strait to Cook Strait.</p>

<p>In the North Island the Auckland Society introduced two hares
in 1868 and nine in 1871. I can find no other record. From the
Auckland District they spread south, and other acclimatization
societies assisted to distribute them far and wide. Wellington
liberated two in 1874, fourteen in 1875, and four in 1876; and
in 1885 reported them as “numerous in the vicinity of Wellington
and the lower end of the Wairarapa Valley.” In more recent
years they are reported as in large numbers about Marton, increasing
about Pahiatua, and as seen in almost every part of the
Eketahuna district. The Taranaki Society introduced them in
1876, and they were reported as thriving in 1884. On Mount
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>Egmont at the present time they are common about the bush-line,
and in the summer months up to 6,000 ft. In 1905 the Waimarino
Society purchased and liberated a number, and protected them for
two years. Later on they became so numerous that they were
declared to be no longer game, and all restrictions about shooting
them were removed. I learn from Mr. E. Phillips Turner,
of the New Zealand Forest Department, that they are found all
through the volcanic plateau of the North Island from Rotorua to
Waiouru.</p>

<p>In no part of New Zealand have they increased to a greater
extent than in South Canterbury, where they became so abundant
that a considerable export trade sprang up, mostly from the Port
of Timaru. Thus the total number of frozen hares exported from
New Zealand in 1910 was declared at 10,744, and in 1911 at
11,418. The number has varied in subsequent years, but is still
very considerable. It is probable that a good many hares are
exported but declared in the Customs returns as rabbits.</p>

<p>In some parts of New Zealand hares tend to become white in
the winter season, just as they do in parts of the Old Country,
following the same seasonal variations as occur in ferrets, stoats,
and other sub-Arctic animals. Several observers state that this is
a familiar phenomenon in South Canterbury.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Hedgehog</span> (<i>Erinaceus europaeus</i>).</h3>

<p>This interesting little animal belongs to an order called the
Insectivora, not because they are the only mammals which eat
insects, but because the latter creatures, with worms and other
“small fry,” constitute the whole, or nearly the whole, of their
food. Hedgehogs are small, stoutly-built animals, with very short
tails, and the greater part of the hairs on the upper surface are
converted into spines. They have the power of rolling themselves
into balls, and these spines thus constitute a most powerful defensive
armour. The spines are about 1 in. long, and are hard and
sharp; they are greyish in colour, with a dark-brown or nearly
black ring a little above the middle. The legs are short, so that
the animal runs with its belly nearly touching the ground, and
the feet have five toes. A full-grown hedgehog is about 10 in.
long. When a tame hedgehog is poked on the forehead it puts
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>its head down, erects its bristles like a crest, and utters little
short grunts; sometimes they make this grunting noise at night.
In the cauldron scene in Macbeth Shakespeare makes the Second
Witch say, “Thrice and once the hedge-pig whined.”</p>

<p>In the colder parts of Europe the hedgehog becomes torpid
in winter, and lies asleep for months in a nest of moss or leaves,
usually in a hole or sheltered hollow. I do not know how long it
hibernates in New Zealand. It wakes up in spring, very hungry,
and in its excursions, which are undertaken at night, it proceeds
to make up for lost time, and runs about with a quick shuffling
gait. It is particularly fond of beetles, but it eats all sorts of
insects, as well as worms, slugs, and small snails. Occasionally it
goes for bigger things, such as frogs and mice, young birds, and
especially eggs. It has been credited with turning a hen off her
nest and eating her eggs. Sometimes it eats vegetables, and I
am told that about Christchurch it digs the potatoes out of the
rows. On the whole, however, it is a beneficial animal in a garden.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<a name="hedgehog" id="hedgehog"><img src="images/hedgehog_i_109.jpg" alt="hedgehog" width="700" height="324" /></a>
<p class="attr-photo">[<i>J. Macdonald, photo.</i></p>
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 14.&mdash;The Hedgehog.</span></p>
</div>

<p>
<br />
</p>

<p>The first hedgehogs brought into New Zealand were received
in 1870 by the Canterbury Acclimatization Society, which got a
pair, but I do not know what came of them.</p>

<p>In 1885 a shipment of one hundred was made to the Otago
Society, but only three survived the voyage. These were liberated
in a suburban garden, but were very sluggish, though the weather
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>was warm; this was probably due to their having lost their usual
season of hibernation. Others were probably imported later, for
in 1890 hedgehogs were found near Port Chalmers.</p>

<p>In 1894 the late Mr. Peter Cunningham, of Merivale, Christchurch,
sent a consignment of wekas Home, and got twelve hedgehogs
out in exchange. They were placed in a pigeon-house, but got
out under the wire netting and escaped. For years nothing was
heard of them, but they gradually increased and are now extraordinarily
abundant. Mr. Edgar F. Stead, of Riccarton, writing
in March, 1916, says, “If I hunted through my garden with my
dog I could get a dozen now, and I frequently kill them. They
are extraordinarily destructive to chickens, their depredations
being readily identified by the fact that they eat their victim’s
stomach first, whereas a cat eats the breast first, and rats and
weasels go for the head and neck. Once a hedgehog starts eating
chickens he will go on until caught or the supply runs out. I know
of many cases where a trap set and baited with the remains of a
chicken has caught the marauding hedgehog.”</p>

<p>These animals are now very abundant between Christchurch and
Dunedin. Two pairs were introduced into the gardens at New
Plymouth in 1913, and they are now increasing rapidly in
Taranaki.</p>

<p>Old superstitions and beliefs are difficult to eradicate. Among
my correspondents, one who hails (over forty years ago) from
Surrey, England, is a firm believer in the myth that hedgehogs
visit the cows during the night and suck their milk; and he warns
me that the milking-qualities of cows are frequently destroyed by
them. I can find no satisfactory evidence of this.</p>

be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
